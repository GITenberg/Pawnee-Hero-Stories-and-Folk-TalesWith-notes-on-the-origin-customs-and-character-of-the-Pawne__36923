<h2>NOTE.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Last</span> spring I visited the Pawnee Agency in the
Indian Territory. On the day after my arrival, I
rode over to the house of Eagle Chief, whom, under
his warrior name, White Eagle, I had known for
many years. Entering the door, I found myself in
the presence of the Chief, who, after quickly putting
his hand over his mouth in his astonishment,
greeted me with a cordial deep-voiced <i>Lau</i>. Then
we sat down and filled the pipe and talked. Through
all our talk I could see that he was curious to know
the object of my visit. At last he said, &ldquo;My son I
am glad that you have come to us once more. My
mind is big when I look at you and talk to you. It
is good that you are here. Why have you come
again to the Pawnee village? What brings you here
at this time?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I answered, &ldquo;Father, we have come down here to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>vi]</a></span>
visit the people and to talk to them; to ask them
about how things used to be in the olden times, to
hear their stories, to get their history, and then to
put all these things down in a book, so that in the
years to come, after the tribe have all become like
white people, the old things of the Pawnees shall
not be forgotten.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Chief meditated for a while and then said,
&ldquo;It is good and it is time. Already the old things
are being lost, and those who knew the secrets are
many of them dead. If we had known how to write,
we would have put all these things down, and they
would not have been forgotten, but we could not
write, and these stories were handed down from one
to another. The old men told their grandchildren,
and they told their grandchildren, and so the secrets
and the stories and the doings of long ago have been
handed down. It may be that they have changed as
they passed from father to son, and it is well that
they should be put down, so that our children, when
they are like the white people, can know what were
their fathers&rsquo; ways.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Most of the material contained in this little book
was collected on that visit.</p>

<h2>THE PAWNEES AND THEIR STORIES.</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">O</span>NCE the Pawnees were a great people. They
were very numerous. They were undisputed
masters of a vast territory. They had everything
that heart could wish. Their corn and their buffalo
gave them food, clothing and shelter; they had
weapons for war and for the chase. They roamed
over the country without let or hindrance. In peace
they were light-hearted and contented; in war cunning,
fierce and successful. Their name was a terror
to their enemies. This was in the past. Now they
are few in number, poor, a prey to disease, a vanishing
race.</p>

<p>My acquaintance with the tribe began in 1870.
From that time to the present I have had frequent
intercourse with them; have lived in their villages;
and been with them on their buffalo hunts. During
the weeks and months spent in camp and village, I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>x]</a></span>
have listened to many stories of Pawnee heroes and
to folk-tales of the miraculous doings of the olden
time. In my intercourse with the tribe, extending
over a period of nearly twenty years, I have been
deeply impressed by the high qualities of the Pawnee
character; and the more familiar I have become
with this people, the more strongly have I felt that
a permanent record should be made of the tales
which reflect that character. Unless thus collected
now, much of this lore must inevitably be forgotten.</p>

<p>For the Pawnees are passing away. When I first
joined them on their buffalo hunts from their old
home on the Loup Fork in Nebraska, the tribe
numbered three thousand; last March in the Indian
Territory I found but eight hundred. And more
rapidly than the dwindling of the people are their
traditions lapsing from memory under the changed
conditions of the tribe&rsquo;s life. The lore, which sprang
up as an indigenous growth of the wide-stretching
prairie and the wilderness where the wild Pawnee
warrior hunted free, finds scanty nurture in the uncongenial
soil of fields tilled by Pawnee followers of
the plow. With the new modes of living come new
views of life, new motives, new sympathies&mdash;in a
word, civilization. To earn a living by toil, to wrest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>xi]</a></span>
subsistence from the earth, this is the problem confronting
the Pawnees to-day, the task which is engaging
the sinew and purpose of the tribe. In the
transition stage, the memory of the old days, of
old manners and rites and ceremonies and of old
heroes, is with the elders of the race, those ancient
braves whose lives bridge the past and the present.
When I visited the Agency last March, it was to
write down from the lips of these old men such material
as I could collect. When they shall die much
of the unwritten lore will perish too, for with them
will cease that sympathetic and perfect credence,
which alone gives to folk-lore vitality and lastingness.
What is written in this volume then belongs
distinctly to the wild Indian.</p>

<p>The task that I have set for myself is that of a recorder.
No attempt has been made to give a literary
color to the hero stories and folk-tales here
written out. I have scrupulously avoided putting
into them anything of my own. The stories are told
to the reader as they were told to me. They are not
elaborated. I have tried to show how Indians think
and speak, rather than to make their stories more
entertaining by dressing them up to suit the civilized
taste. My object in giving these narratives in their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>xii]</a></span>
present shape is to make a book which shall be true
to life, and shall faithfully reflect the Pawnee character,
as the story tellers have themselves painted it.
In a very few cases I have added some words explaining
matters so well understood by those familiar
with the Indians as to need no explanation. If
these tales have any ethnological value, it will be
enhanced by their being given in the precise form
in which they were told by those to whom they have
been handed down from generation to generation;
but quite apart from this is another point which is
entitled to consideration.</p>

<p>The entire ignorance concerning Indians, which
prevails among the general public, can be dispelled
only by letting that public understand something of
the ways of life of the wild Indian, something of the
subjects about which he thinks and talks, as well as
of how he looks at these subjects, and what he has
to say about them.</p>

<p>The late Mrs. Jackson&rsquo;s charming story, &ldquo;Ramona,&rdquo;
did much to bring the more intelligent class
of readers in touch with the Indians, and to awaken
sympathy for them by pointing out the unnumbered
wrongs perpetrated on this race by the Government.
Mrs. Jackson&rsquo;s book was a story, a novel; wonderfully
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>xiii]</a></span>
well told and full of truth and feeling; but
while it may have been a relation of facts, it did
not profess to treat of actual persons. It is looked
upon by many readers as a mere romance. It is a
book about which I was once asked, skeptically,
&ldquo;Did you ever see any Indians like those?&rdquo; In the
Pawnee stories here set down there is no romance
nor coloring. The Indians themselves are talking,
and whatever the faults and weak points of these
tales&mdash;and some of them are sufficiently obvious&mdash;they
at least give the reader a true conception of
Indians as they have actually lived. They are stories
of Indians by Indians. There is about them nothing
of the white man; and the intelligent person, who
is sufficiently interested in the subject to read this
book through, will gain from it a new insight into
Indian character.</p>

<p>The Indian of Cooper&mdash;with his bravery, his
endurance, his acuteness, his high qualities of honesty,
generosity, courtesy and hospitality&mdash;has been
laughed at for half a century. Yet every man who
has mingled much with the Indians in their homes
has known individuals who might have sat for the
portraits which Cooper drew of some of his aboriginal
heroes. There are good men among Indians,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>xiv]</a></span>
just as among the whites. The prevalent notion of
the Indian has been formed from the worst class of
this people, the lazy, filthy beggars who haunt the
settlements of the West, who to their own vices have
added new ones picked up from their surroundings,
and who are hopelessly degraded. These are not
typical Indians, and it is unjust to judge a whole
race from such degenerate specimens. There is still
another notion of the Indian fondly cherished by
many worthy people, whose sympathies have been
wrought upon by the cruelty and injustice with
which we have treated this race. These good people
look upon all Indians as simple children of nature,
who would do no wrong if they had not been contaminated
by contact with vicious whites. It is unnecessary
to say that this notion of the Indian is also
incorrect.</p>

<p>The Indian is neither a fiend nor a saint. There
are good ones and bad ones. As a rule, perhaps they
try to act up to their ideas of what is right, but the
standard of a race of barbarians cannot be the same
as that of a civilized people, and in judging of their
character we must make allowances for this difference.
The standard of right and wrong among
civilized people is a growth, the product of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>xv]</a></span>
experience of thousands of years. The Indian races
have not been through a like experience. They have
regarded as virtues some things which seem to us
the worst of crimes. The Indian differs from the
white man in education and manner of life, and so,
of course, in his modes of thought. He has not
been taught the lesson of self-control, which his surroundings
oblige each civilized man to begin to learn
as a child. He has known until recent times no law
save that of strength. He has been taught that war
is the noblest of pursuits&mdash;the only one worthy of
man. And that war has consisted in making forays
upon his enemies, taking their possessions, and, if
possible, their lives and their scalps. His warfare
consisted in surprises rather than open combat. A
scalp taken was a trophy of victory, and the scalp
of a woman was almost as eagerly sought as that of
a brave or of a chief. It was an evidence of injury
inflicted on the enemy. To steal horses from the
enemy was an achievement creditable and also profitable.</p>

<p>We commonly speak of the raids of war parties as
horse stealing expeditions, but this is wholly misleading,
because to the civilized understanding the
phrase horse stealing carries with it an idea of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>xvi]</a></span>
dishonesty. No such meaning attaches to the Indian
equivalent of this phrase. They take horses by
stratagem or secretly, by the usual, and to them
legitimate, methods of warfare. To speak of their
stealing horses, using that verb in the sense which
we commonly give it, would be like saying that an
army stole the cannon which it captured in an
engagement with the enemy. Captured horses were
the legitimate spoils of war. The wealth of the
Indians was in their horses. They had no fortified
places, no ships of war, no cannon, no works of art.
Their only valuable possessions were their horses.
These were the only property that could be carried
off. Therefore, when an expedition was made
against a hostile tribe, scalps and horses were naturally
its object. Horses, being their only valuable
possessions, constituted their medium of exchange, so
far as they had any. Did a man wish to purchase
an ornament, or an article of dress which took his
fancy, he gave a horse for it. If he bought a wife
he paid for her in horses. The most valuable present
that could be made was a good horse; and
horses were often given by the well-to-do to their
friends and relations who had been sick or unfortunate.
On the other hand, when, as was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>xvii]</a></span>
sometimes the case, a conquered tribe was condemned
to pay a war indemnity, they paid it in horses. It is
related that when the Skidi broke their treaty with
the other bands, and were afterward conquered by
them, they were obliged to pay such a fine.</p>

<p>This view of Indian warfare being understood,
the motive of the hero stories here given, and of
many of the folk-tales, becomes plain.</p>

<p>The Pawnees are essentially a religious people.
They worship <i>Ti-ra&acute;-wa</i>, who is in and of everything.
Unlike many of the Indian tribes of the West, they
do not adore any material thing. They regard certain
places as sacred, but these are so only because
blessed by the Divine presence. The Pawnee Deity
is not personified. He is intangible, quite as much so
as the God of the Christians. The sacred character
of <i>Ti-ra&acute;-wa</i> extends to animal nature. The fishes
which swim in the rivers, the birds of the air and the
beasts which roam over the prairie, have sometimes
intelligence, knowledge and power far beyond those
of man. But they are not gods. Their miraculous
attributes are given them by the Ruler, whose servants
they are, and who often makes them the medium
of his communications to man. They are his
messengers&mdash;his angels&mdash;and their powers are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>xviii]</a></span>
always used for good. Prayers are made to them;
sometimes for direct help in time of need, but more
often for intercession. Often in the folk-tales it will
be seen that when the blessing asked for is some
small thing, a prayer is made to the animals (<i>Nahu&acute;rac</i>),
but if the petitioners are asking for some
great thing, something which is very difficult to
grant, then the prayer is made to &ldquo;One Above,&rdquo; to
&ldquo;The Ruler,&rdquo; that is, to the Supreme Being.</p>

<p>Nothing of importance was ever undertaken without
a prayer for help, for success. All the serious
undertakings of the year, whose success would affect
the general welfare, were preceded by religious ceremonies,
when all the tribe took part, and prayers
were made and sacrifices offered to <i>Ti-ra&acute;-wa</i>; and
in all lesser enterprises, the individuals who were
interested humbled themselves and implored the
Divine assistance. A party starting off on the warpath
prayed for success and made a burnt offering.
Prayer and sacrifice always marked the beginning of
the feast, and often its end. Success in their undertakings
was acknowledged by grateful offerings to
the Ruler. The victorious warrior sometimes sacrificed
the scalp torn from the head of his enemy, and
this was burned with elaborate ceremonies by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>xix]</a></span>
High Priest. He who brought back from a foray
many horses, gave one to the priest as a thank-offering
to the Ruler. One of the well-known Seven
Brothers said to me, &ldquo;It is our aim, after we have
been helped, to give thanks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The feeling of these Indians toward their God is
one of humility and reverence. They do not love
him, but they look to him for help at all times. The
young are exhorted to humble themselves before
him, to pray to him, to look to One Above, to ask
help from the Ruler. In the stories which are included
in this book the allusions constantly made to
<i>Ti-ra&acute;-wa</i>&mdash;the Supreme Power&mdash;the prayers offered
and the humility and self-abnegation so often expressed,
show faith, profound religious feelings, and
great elevation of thought.</p>


<p class="break">Among tribal names of North American Indians,
none is more familiar to us than Pawnee; yet of no
tribe is less known. Frequent allusions to them occur
in the writings of early travelers in the West;
but only one satisfactory attempt has been made to
write a connected history of this family. In the
<i>Magazine of American History</i> for 1880 Mr. John
B. Dunbar published a most interesting account of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>xx]</a></span>
this tribe, but his sketch is mainly historical, and
does not profess to treat exhaustively of the lives
and modes of thought of this people. It is, however,
a history of very great importance and value,
and in preparing the historical matter which is included
in this volume, I have not hesitated to draw
on Mr. Dunbar&rsquo;s papers, which must form the basis
of any subsequent account of the Pawnees, and
which should be read by all who are interested in
this people.</p>

<p>I owe much of my interest in and knowledge of
the Pawnees to my long intimacy with the late
Major Frank North, who from his extended intercourse
and close connection with this people&mdash;a connection
which lasted more than thirty years&mdash;was
unquestionably better informed about them than
any other white man has ever been; and with Capt.
L.&nbsp;H. North, his brother, who was for many years
associated with Major North in command of the
Pawnee Scouts.</p>

<p>In gathering the material here presented I have
been assisted also by James R. Murie, a nephew of
Comanche Chief; by Ralph J. Weeks, a half-brother
of Lone Chief; by Harry Kuhns, by Eagle Chief
and Bear Chief, Skidis; by Good Chief and Curly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxi" id="Page_xxi">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>xxi]</a></span>
Chief, Kit-ke-hahk&acute;-is; by Secret Pipe Chief and
Frank White, Chau-is, and by many others of my
Pawnee friends, to all of whom my acknowledgments
are due.</p>

<p>In the pronunciation of the few Pawnee words used
in these stories, the vowel sounds, as nearly as I can
give them, are as follows: <i>a</i> as in father, <i>e</i> as the <i>a</i> in
ale, <i>i</i> as <i>e</i> in cede, <i>&#363;</i> long as <i>oo</i> in pool, <i>&#365;</i> short as in
us, <i>au</i> as <i>ou</i> in house. These sounds depend somewhat
on the letters which follow the vowels, and the
spelling does not always conform to the rule laid
down. The last two syllables in the word Pita-hau-erat,
for example, are pronounced <i>&#275;r&#259;t</i> or <i>idot</i>. The
sounds of <i>d</i>, <i>l</i>, <i>n</i> and <i>r</i> are difficult to express by
English letters; <i>r</i> sometimes has its own sound quite
distinctly, at others more the sound of <i>d</i>; <i>n</i> often has
a <i>d</i> sound, and <i>l</i> a sound of <i>n</i>. It will be noted that
throughout this volume I have used the familiar
English word Pawnee instead of the evidently more
correct <i>Pa&acute;-ni</i>.</p>

<p>Finally I have refrained from commenting on the
stories, though there is abundant opportunity for
comment.</p>

<h3>COMANCHE CHIEF.</h3>

<p class="center smcap">The Peace-Maker.</p>


<h4>I.</h4>

<p><span class="dropcap">M</span>ANY years ago there lived in the Ski&acute;-di village
a young man, about sixteen years old.
His name was <i>Kut-a&acute;wi-kutz</i> (the hawk). At this
time the Pawnees wore their hair in the ancient
fashion, cut as the Osages wear theirs; the whole
head was shaved except a roach running back from
the forehead beyond the scalp lock.</p>

<p>A war party went off to the south and he joined
them as a servant. They went a long way and a
long way, traveling far, but they got no horses and
came back. Afterward another party started off on
the warpath, and he went with it. They traveled
many days, going to the southwest, and at length
they came to a camp, and hid themselves to wait until
it was dark. It was a camp of the Comanches.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>26]</a></span>
When night had come they all went into the camp
to steal horses. This young man went to a lodge near
which stood three horses, two spotted horses and one
gray. They were tied near the door of the lodge, and
from this he thought they must be fast, for the Indians
usually tie up their best horses close to the lodge
door, where they will be under their eyes as much
as possible. He went to the lodge to cut the ropes,
and just as he was about to do so he thought he
heard some one inside. He stepped up close to the
lodge, and looked in through a little opening between
the door and the lodge, and saw a small fire burning,
and on the other side of the fire was sitting a young
girl, combing her long hair. The young man looked
around the lodge to see who else was there, and saw
only an old man and an old woman, and the fire-maker.
He cut the ropes of the two spotted horses
standing outside, led the horses out of the camp, and
met his companion. To him he said, &ldquo;Now, brother,
you take these horses and go to the hill where we
were hiding to-day, and wait for me there. I have
seen another fine spotted horse that I want to get; I
will go back for it and will meet you before morning
at that place.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He went back, as if to get the spotted horse, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>27]</a></span>
returned to the lodge where the girl was. He went
all around it, and looked at it carefully. He saw
that there were feathers on the lodge, and rows of
animals hoofs hanging down the sides, which rattled
in the wind, and to one of the lodge-poles was tied a
buffalo tail, which hung down. Then he went back
to the door and looked in at the girl again. She
had braided her hair and was sitting there by the
fire. He stayed there a long time that night looking
at her. Toward morning he went to look for his
companion. When he met him he told him that
some one had taken the spotted horse before he got
to it; he could not find it. When the party all met
next morning, they found that they had taken a lot
of horses, and they started north to go home. They
reached the Pawnee village, and every one was glad
of their success.</p>

<p>After this, whenever this young man saw anything
that was nice or pretty, such as medals, ear-rings,
finger rings for women, beadwork leggings, bracelets,
necklaces, wampum, beads&mdash;things that the
Comanches did not have&mdash;he would give a pony for
it. For one year he went on like this, gathering
together these pretty things. When the year had
gone by he had no horses left; he had given them
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>28]</a></span>
all away to get these presents. He packed all these
things up in a bundle, and then spoke one night to
his friend, saying, &ldquo;I intend to go off on the warpath
again, and I would like to have you go with
me; we two will go alone.&rdquo; His friend agreed to go.</p>


<h4>II.</h4>

<p>Before the time came to start, other young men
heard of it, and several joined them. There were
eight of them in all. <i>Kut-a&acute;wi-kutz</i> was the leader.
He told his young men that they were going to a certain
place where he knew there were lots of spotted
horses to steal. They started out on foot. After
traveling many days, they came to the place where
the camp had been at the time he saw the girl.
There was now no camp there.</p>

<p>They went on further, and at length came to a
camp and hid themselves. When night came the
leader told his men to remain where they were hiding,
and he would go into the camp and see if there
were any horses to take. He went through all the
camp looking for the lodge in which he had seen the
girl, but he did not find it. Then he went back to
where the young men were hiding, and told them
that this was not the camp they were looking for;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>29]</a></span>
that they did not have here the spotted horses that
they wanted. In the camp of the year before there
had been many spotted horses.</p>

<p>The young men did not understand this, and
some of them did not like to leave this camp without
taking any horses, but he was the leader and
they did as he said. They left that camp and went
on further.</p>

<p>After traveling some days they came to another
camp, and hid themselves near it. When night came
on <i>Kut-a&acute;wi-kutz</i> said to his young men, &ldquo;You stay
here where you are hiding, and I will go into this
camp and see if it is the one we are looking for.&rdquo;
He went through the camp but did not find the
lodge he sought. He returned to the hiding place,
and told the party there that this was not the camp
they were looking for, that the spotted horses were
not there. They left the camp and went on.</p>

<p>When they had come close to the mountains they
saw another camp. <i>Kut-a&acute;wi-kutz</i> went into this
camp alone, and when he had been through it, he
went back to his party and told them that this was
the camp they had been looking for. Then he sent
the young men into the camp to steal horses, and he
put on his fine leggings and moccasins that he had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>30]</a></span>
in his bundle, and painted himself and went with
them. He took a horse and his friend took one.
They met outside the village. He told his friend to
get on his own horse and lead the other, and with
the rest of the party to go off east from the camp
to a certain place, and there to wait for him. &ldquo;I
have seen,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;another fine horse that I like,
and I wish to go back and get it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His friend looked sorrowfully at him and said,
&ldquo;Why are you all dressed up like this, and why is
your face painted? What are you doing or what is
in your mind? Perhaps you intend to do some great
thing to-night that you do not want me, your friend,
to know about. I have seen for a long time that
you are hiding something from me.&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>Kut-a&acute;wi-kutz</i> caught his friend in his arms and
hugged him and kissed him and said, &ldquo;You are my
friend; who is so near to me as you are? Go on as I
have said, and if it turns out well I will tell you all.
I will catch up with you before very long.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His friend said, &ldquo;No, I will stay with you. I will
not go on. I love you as a brother, and I will stay
with you, and if you are going to do some great
thing I will die with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When <i>Kut-a&acute;wi-kutz</i> found that his friend was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>31]</a></span>
resolved to remain with him, he yielded and told him
his secret. He said to him, &ldquo;My brother, when we
were on the warpath a year ago, and I took those
two spotted horses, I heard a little noise in the lodge
by which they were tied. I looked in and I saw
there a girl sitting by the fire combing her hair. She
was very pretty. When I took the spotted horses
away, I could not put that girl out of my mind. I
remembered her. Brother, when we went back home
that girl was constantly in my mind. I could not
forget her. I came this time on purpose to get her,
even if it shall cost me my life. She is in this camp,
and I have found the lodge where she lives.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His friend said, &ldquo;My brother, whatever you say
shall be done. I stay with you. You go into the
camp. I will take the horses and go to that high
rocky hill east of the camp, and will hide the horses
there. When you are in the village I will be up in
one of the trees on the top of the hill, looking down
on the camp. If I hear shooting and see lots of
people running to the lodge I will know that you
are killed, and I will kill myself. I will not go home
alone. If I do not see you by noon, I will kill myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>Kut-a&acute;wi-kutz</i> said, &ldquo;It is good. If I am successful
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>32]</a></span>
I will go up there after you, and take you down
into the camp.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They parted. The friend hid the horses and
went up on the hill. <i>Kut-a&acute;wi-kutz</i> went into the
camp.</p>


<h4>III.</h4>

<p>It was now the middle of the night. When he
came to the lodge, he saw there was a fire in it. He
did not go in at once; he wanted the fire to go out.
He stayed around the lodge, and gradually the fire
died down. It was dark. He went into the lodge.
He was painted and finely dressed, and had his
bundle with him. He took his moccasins off and
his leggings, and hung them up over the girl&rsquo;s bed;
then strings of beads, then five or six medals, bracelets,
ear-bobs, beaded leggings, everything he had&mdash;his
shirt. He took his blanket, and spread it over
the bed where the girl was lying, stepped over the
bed, and crept under his own blanket, and lay down
by her side.</p>

<p>When he lay down she woke up, and found that
there was some one lying by her, and she spoke to
him, but he did not answer. He could not understand
her, for he did not know Comanche. She
talked for a long time, but he did not speak. Then
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>33]</a></span>
she began to feel of him, and when she put her
hands on his head&mdash;<i>Pi-ta&acute;-da</i>&mdash;Pawnee&mdash;an enemy!
Then she raised herself up, took a handful of grass
from under the bed, spread the fire and put the grass
on it. The fire blazed up and she saw him. Then
she sprang up and took the top blanket, which was
his, off the bed, and put it about her, and sat by the
fire. She called her father and said, &ldquo;Father get up;
there is a man here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The old man got up, and got his pipe and began
smoking. This old man was the Head Chief of the
Comanches. He called the servant, and told him to
make a fire. The girl got up and went over to where
her mother was lying and called her. The mother
got up; and they all sat by the fire.</p>

<p>The old man smoked for a long time. Every now
and then he would look at the bed to see who it
could be that was lying there, and then he would
look at all the things hanging up over the bed&mdash;at
the medals and other things. He did not know what
they were for, and he wondered. At length the old
man told the servant to go and call the chiefs of the
tribe, and tell them to come to his lodge.</p>

<p>Presently the chiefs came in one by one and sat
down. When they had come there was still one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>34]</a></span>
brave who ought to have come that was not there.
His name was Skin Shirt; the father wanted him.
He sent for him three times. He sent word back to
the chief to go on with the council, and that he
would agree to whatever they decided. The fourth
time he was sent for he came, and took a seat by the
chief, the girl&rsquo;s father. This brave spoke to <i>Kut-a&acute;wi-kutz</i>,
and told him to get up, and take a seat
among them. He did so. The girl was sitting on
the other side of the fire. When he got up, he had
to take the blanket that was left, which was the girl&rsquo;s.
He put it around him, and sat down among them.</p>

<p>When the chiefs came in, there was among them
a Pawnee who had been captured long ago and
adopted by the Comanches, and was now himself a
chief; he talked with <i>Kut-a&acute;wi-kutz</i> and interpreted
for him, telling him everything that was said as each
one spoke.</p>

<p>After the young man had seated himself, the chief
filled his pipe, and gave the pipe to his brave to
decide what should be done with this enemy. The
brave took the pipe, but he did not wish to decide,
so he did not light it, but passed it on to another
chief to decide. He passed it on to another, and he
to another, and so it went until the pipe came back
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>35]</a></span>
to the Head Chief. When he got it again, he asked
<i>Kut-a&acute;wi-kutz</i>, &ldquo;Why have you come here this night
and lain down in my lodge, you who are an enemy to
my people? And why have you hung up in the lodge
all these strange things which we see here? I do not
understand it, and I wish to know your reasons.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boy said to him, &ldquo;A long time ago I came
south on the warpath to steal horses. I traveled
until I came to your camp. I saw three horses tied
outside a lodge, two spotted horses and a gray.
While I was cutting one of the ropes, I heard a little
noise inside the lodge, and pushing aside the door I
looked in, and saw that girl combing her hair. I
stole the two spotted horses, and took them out of
the camp, and gave them to a friend of mine, and
came back to your lodge, and kept looking at the
girl. I stayed there until she went to bed. For a
long year I have been buying presents; beads and
many other things, for I had made up my mind that
I would go after this girl. I came down here to find
her. I have been to where you were camped last year,
and to two other camps that I discovered. She was
not in these and I left them, and came on until I
found the right camp. This is the fourth place. Now
I am here. I made up my mind to do this thing, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>36]</a></span>
if her relations do not like it they can do as they
please. I would be happy to die on her account.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When he had spoken the old chief laughed. He
said: &ldquo;Those two spotted horses that you stole I did
not care much about. The gray horse was the best
one of the three, and you left him. I was glad that
you did not take him. He was the best of all.&rdquo;
Then for a little while there was silence in the
lodge.</p>

<p>Then the chief, the girl&rsquo;s father, began to talk
again; he said, &ldquo;If I wanted to decide what should
be done with this man, I would decide right now, but
here is my brave, Skin Shirt, I want him to decide.
If I were to decide, it would be against this man, but
he has my daughter&rsquo;s blanket on, and she has his,
and I do not want to decide. I pass the pipe to my
brave, and want him to light it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The brave said, &ldquo;I want this chief next to me to
decide,&rdquo; and he passed him the pipe, and so it went
on around the circle until it came to the Head Chief
again. He was just about to take it and decide the
question, when they heard outside the lodge the
noise made by some one coming, shouting and
laughing; then the door was pushed aside and an old
man came in, and as he passed the door he stumbled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>37]</a></span>
and fell on his knees. It was the girl&rsquo;s grandfather.
He had been outside the lodge, listening.</p>

<p>The pipe was passed to the chief, and he gave it
again to his brave to decide. While the brave was
sitting there, holding the pipe, the old grandfather
said, &ldquo;Give me the pipe, if you men cannot decide,
let me do it. In my time we did not do things this
way. I never passed the pipe; I could always decide
for myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Skin Shirt passed him the pipe, and he lit it
and smoked. Then he said, &ldquo;I do not wish to condemn
to death a man who is wearing my granddaughter&rsquo;s
blanket.&rdquo; The interpreter began to tell
<i>Kut-a&acute;wi-kutz</i> that the old man was going to decide
in his favor, and that when he got through speaking
he must get up and pass his hands over him, and
thank him for taking pity on him, and so to all the
others. The old man continued, &ldquo;Now, chiefs, do
not think hardly of what I am going to say, nor be
dissatisfied with my decision. I am old. I have
heard in my time that there is a tribe up north that
is raising from the ground something that is long and
white, and something that is round; and that these
things are good to eat. Now, chiefs, before I die, I
want to eat of these things, and I want my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>38]</a></span>
granddaughter to go and take her seat by this man, and
for them to be man and wife. Since I was young we
have been enemies, but now I want the two tribes to
come together, join hands and be friends.&rdquo; And so
it was decided.</p>

<p>The young man got up and passed his hands over
the old man, and over the brave, and passed around
the circle and blessed them all. The Pawnee, who
was interpreter, now told him to get up, and get a
medal and put it on the brave, and then another and
put it on the chief, and so on until all the presents
were gone. And he did so, and put on them the
medals, and ear-rings, and strings of beads, and
breast-plates of wampum, until each had something.
And these things were new to them, and they felt
proud to be wearing them, and thought how nice
they looked.</p>


<h4>IV.</h4>

<p>By this time it was daylight, and it had got noised
abroad through the camp that there was a Pawnee at
the Head Chief&rsquo;s lodge, and all the people gathered
there. They called out, &ldquo;Bring him out; we want
him out here.&rdquo; They crowded about the lodge, all
the people, the old men and the women and the
young men, so many that at last they pushed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>39]</a></span>
the lodge down. They shouted: &ldquo;Let us have the
Pawnee. Last night they stole many horses from
us.&rdquo; The chiefs and braves got around the Pawnee,
and kept the Comanches off from him, and protected
him from the people. The Cheyennes were camped
close by, near the hill southeast of the Comanches,
and they, too, had heard that the Comanches had a
Pawnee in the camp. They came over, and rode
about in the crowd to try and get the Pawnee, and
they rode over a Comanche or two, and knocked
them down. So Skin Shirt got his bow and arrows,
and jumped on his horse, and rode out and drove the
Cheyennes away back to their camp again.</p>

<p>The Cheyennes saw that the Comanches did not
want the Pawnee killed, so they sent a message inviting
him over to a feast with them, intending to
kill him, but Skin Shirt told them that he was married
into the tribe. While the Cheyennes were parading
round the Comanche camp, they were shooting off
their guns in the air, just to make a noise. Now, the
young Pawnee on the hill, who was watching the
camp to see what would happen to his friend, saw
the crowd and heard the shooting, and made up his
mind that <i>Kut-a&acute;wi-kutz</i> had been killed. So he took
his knife, and put the handle against a tree and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>40]</a></span>
point against his breast, and put his arms around the
tree and hugged it, and the knife blade passed
through his heart and he fell down and died.</p>

<p>In the afternoon when all the excitement had
quieted down, the Cheyennes came over again to the
Comanche camp, and invited the Pawnee and his wife
to go to their village, and visit with them. Then Skin
Shirt said, &ldquo;All right, we will go.&rdquo; Three chiefs of
the Comanches went ahead, the Pawnee followed
with his wife, and Skin Shirt went behind. They
went to the Cheyenne camp. The Cheyennes received
them and made a great feast for them, and
gave the Pawnee many horses. Then they went back
to the Comanche camp. <i>Kut-a&acute;wi-kutz</i> never went
up to the hill until the next morning. Then he went,
singing the song he had told his friend he would
sing. He called to him, but there was no reply. He
called again. It was all silent. He looked for his
friend, and at last he found him there dead at the
foot of the tree.</p>


<h4>V.</h4>

<p><i>Kut-a&acute;wi-kutz</i> then stayed with the Comanches.
The Cheyennes came north and east, and the Comanches
went on west, nearer to the mountains.
While the Pawnee was with the Comanches, they had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>41]</a></span>
several wars with the Utes, Lipans and Tonkaways.
<i>Kut-a&acute;wi-kutz</i> proved himself a brave man, and, as
the son-in-law of the chief, he soon gained great influence,
and was himself made a chief.</p>

<p>After some years the old man, his wife&rsquo;s grandfather,
told the Pawnee that he thought it was time
that he should eat some of those things that he had
long wanted to eat that grew up north; that he was
getting pretty old now. <i>Kut-a&acute;wi-kutz</i> said, &ldquo;It is
time. We will go.&rdquo; So he had his horses packed,
and with his immediate family and the old man,
started north toward the Pawnee country. At this
time he was called <i>Kut-a&acute;wi-kutz-u si-ti&acute;-da-rit</i>, which
means &ldquo;See! The Hawk.&rdquo; When going into battle
he would ride straight out to strike his enemy, and
the Comanches who were looking at him would say,
&ldquo;See! The Hawk.&rdquo; So that became his name.</p>

<p>They traveled a long time until they came to the
Pawnee ground. As they were traveling along, they
came to a field where were growing corn, beans and
squashes. The Pawnee said to the old man, &ldquo;Grandfather,
look at that field. There are the things that
you have desired to eat.&rdquo; He got off his horse and
went into the field, and pulled some corn, some beans
and some squashes, and took them to the old man,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>42]</a></span>
and gave them to him. The old man supposed
they were to be eaten just as they were, and
he tried to bite the squashes. This made the
Pawnee laugh. When they came to the village,
the Pawnees were very glad to see him who had been
lost long ago. He told the people that he had
brought these Indians to eat of the corn and other
things; that they were his kinsfolk. He told them,
too, about the young man who had killed himself.
His relations went out into the fields, and gathered
corn and beans and squashes, and cooked them for
the Comanches.</p>

<p>They stayed there a long time at the Pawnee village.
When they were getting ready to return, the
Pawnees dried their corn, and gave a great deal of it
to the Comanches, packing many horses with it for
the Indians at home. Then the Comanches started
south again, and some of the Pawnee young men,
relations of <i>Kut-a&acute;wi-kutz</i>, joined him, and went back
with them. After they had returned to the Comanche
camp, the old grandfather died, happy because
he had eaten the things he wanted to eat.</p>

<p>Soon after this, <i>Kut-a&acute;wi-kutz</i> started back to the
Pawnee village, and some young men of the Comanches
joined him. Some time after reaching the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>43]</a></span>
village he went south again, accompanied by some
young Pawnees, but leaving most of the Comanches
behind. He had arranged with the chiefs of the
Pawnees that they should journey south, meet the
Comanches on the plains and make peace. When
he reached the Comanches, the whole village started
north to visit the Pawnees, and met them on their
way south. When they met, the two tribes made
friends, smoked together, ate together, became
friends.</p>

<p>After they had camped together for some time,
some Comanches stayed in the Pawnee camp, and
some Pawnees in the Comanche camp. <i>Kut-a&acute;wi-kutz</i>
was called by the Pawnees Comanche Chief.
He would have remained with the Comanches, but
when he went back with them his wife fell sick. The
Comanche doctors could not help her, and he wanted
to take her north to see the Pawnee doctors, but the
Comanches would not let him. They kept him there,
and his wife died. Then he was angry, for he
thought if he had taken her north her life might
have been saved.</p>

<p>So he left the Comanches, and went and lived with
the Pawnees, and was known among them always as
Comanche Chief, the Peace-Maker, because he made
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>44]</a></span>
peace between the Pawnees and Comanches. He
was chief of the Ski&acute;-di band, and a progressive man
of modern times. He sent his children East to
school at Carlisle, Pa.</p>

<p>Comanche Chief died September 9th, 1888.</p>

<h3>LONE CHIEF.</h3>

<p class="center smcap">Sk&#365;r&acute;-ar-a Le-shar.</p>


<h4>I.</h4>

<p><span class="dropcap">L</span>ONE CHIEF was the son of the chief of the
Kit-ke-hahk&acute;-i band. His father died when the
boy was very young, less than a year old. Until he
was old enough to go to war, his mother had supported
him by farming&mdash;raising corn, beans and
pumpkins. She taught the boy many things, and advised
him how to live and how to act so that he might
be successful. She used to say to him, &ldquo;You must
trust always in <i>Ti-ra&acute;-wa</i>. He made us, and through
him we live. When you grow up, you must be a man.
Be brave, and face whatever danger may meet you.
Do not forget, when you look back to your young
days, that I have raised you, and always supported
you. You had no father to do it. Your father was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>46]</a></span>
a chief, but you must not think of that. Because he
was a chief, it does not follow that you will be one.
It is not the man who stays in the lodge that becomes
great; it is the man who works, who sweats, who is
always tired from going on the warpath.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Much good advice his mother gave him. She
said, &ldquo;When you get to be a man, remember that it
is his ambition that makes the man. If you go on
the warpath, do not turn around when you have gone
part way, but go on as far as you were going, and
then come back. If I should live to see you become
a man, I want you to become a great man. I want
you to think about the hard times we have been
through. Take pity on people who are poor, because
we have been poor, and people have taken
pity on us. If I live to see you a man, and to go off
on the warpath, I would not cry if I were to hear that
you had been killed in battle. That is what makes a
man: to fight and to be brave. I should be sorry to
see you die from sickness. If you are killed, I would
rather have you die in the open air, so that the birds
of the air will eat your flesh, and the wind will
breathe on you and blow over your bones. It is
better to be killed in the open air than to be
smothered in the earth. Love your friend and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>47]</a></span>
never desert him. If you see him surrounded by the
enemy, do not run away. Go to him, and if you
cannot save him, be killed together, and let your
bones lie side by side. Be killed on a hill; high up.
Your grandfather said it is not manly to be killed in
a hollow. It is not a man who is talking to you,
advising you. Heed my words, even if I am a
woman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boy listened to these words, and he did not
forget them.</p>


<h4>II.</h4>

<p>In the year 1867 he enlisted in the Pawnee Scouts
under Major Frank North, and served in L.&nbsp;H.
North&rsquo;s company. He was always a good soldier,
ready, willing and brave. At a fight near the Cheyenne
Pass in 1867, he counted <i>coup</i> on a woman and
a man, Arapahoes who had stolen some horses at
Fort Laramie.</p>

<p>At this time the boy&rsquo;s name was <i>Wi-ti-ti le-shar&acute;-uspi</i>,
Running Chief. After he came back from this
scout, he went on a war party of which Left Hand
was the leader, and they went to the Osage country.
He was no longer a servant, but a scout, a leading
man in the party, one of those who went ahead as
spies. He had good judgment and understood his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>48]</a></span>
duties. When they came to the Osage country, he
was selected as one of the leaders of a small branch
party to steal horses. His party took thirty head of
horses. In the Osage country the young men were
not allowed to take all the horses they could. On
account of the few fords where they could cross the
streams, they could not take a big herd, but only
what they could ride and lead, and at the same
time go fast. Across one river there was only one
rocky ford, and over another stream with deep banks
there was only one rocky ford where they could cross.
Because they did not know this, in former times
many Pawnees had been caught and killed in the
Osage country. So now they took but few horses at
a time, because these rivers were very deep and no
one could cross them except at these rock fords.
Out of the horses taken at this time Running Chief
obtained one of the best and fastest ever known
among the Pawnees&mdash;a cream-colored horse, long
famous in the tribe. For his skillful leadership of
this party he was given much credit.</p>

<p>After returning home&mdash;the same year&mdash;he led a
party to go off on the warpath to the Cheyennes.
He found a camp on the headwaters of the North
Canadian, and his party took seven horses, but these
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>49]</a></span>
horses looked thin and rough, and he was not satisfied
with them; he was ashamed to go home with
only these. He told his party to take them home,
but that he was going off by himself to get some
better ones. He had with him a friend, with whom
he had grown up, and whom he loved. This young
man was like a brother to Running Chief. These
two went off together, and went to the Osage camp,
and staid about it for three nights, and then took five
horses, the best in the camp. They took them back
to the village. It was customary for the leading
man in a party to make a sacrifice to <i>Ti-ra&acute;-wa</i>.
Running Chief did this, giving one horse to the
chief priest. This sacrifice promoted him to be a
warrior.</p>


<h4>III.</h4>

<p>The next year he led a party again to the Osage
country. He took some horses and brought them
home. This same year (1868) a party started south.
He was not the leader, but he went with them. They
went to the Wichita, Comanche and Kiowa villages&mdash;they
were all camped together&mdash;stole some
horses and started back with them. Before they had
gone very far Running Chief stopped and said he
was going back. His friend was with the party, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>50]</a></span>
when he found that Running Chief had resolved to
go back he said, &ldquo;I will stop here with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The two went back toward the village that they
had just left, and climbed a hill that stood near it,
and hid themselves there. They waited, watching,
for they had not decided what they would do. The
next day in the afternoon they began to get hungry,
and they began to talk together. Running Chief
said to his friend, &ldquo;My brother, are you poor in
your mind?<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Do you feel like doing some great
thing&mdash;something that is very dangerous?&rdquo;</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_1_1" id="Footnote_1_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a>
Poor in mind; <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>, despondent, unhappy, miserable.</p>
</div>

<p>His friend answered at once, &ldquo;Yes, I am poor.
I am ready. Why do you ask me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Running Chief thought a little while before he
answered, and as he thought, all the pain and suffering
of his life seemed to rise up before him, so that
he could see it. He remembered how he had been
a poor boy, supported by his mother, and all that
they two had suffered together while he was yet a
child. He remembered how his sister had been
killed when he was a boy only ten years old, and how
he had mourned for her, when her husband, who was
jealous of her, had shot her through the body with
an arrow and killed her. She was the only sister he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>51]</a></span>
had, and he had loved her. He felt that he was poor
now, and that there was no hope of anything
better for him, and he did not want to live any
longer. After he had thought of all these things he
said to his friend, &ldquo;My life is not worth anything to
me;&rdquo; and then he told him of his bad feelings.
Finally he said, &ldquo;Now you go off and leave me here
alone. I am tired of living, but you go home. You
have relations who would mourn for you. I do not
want you to lose your life on my account.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His friend answered him, &ldquo;I will not go away
from you. We have grown up together, and I will
stick to you. Wherever you go I will go, and whatever
you do I will do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Running Chief meditated for a long time.
He had not made up his mind what to do. He
thought to himself, &ldquo;This, my friend, will stay with
me. I do not want to be the cause of his death.&rdquo;
So he considered. Finally he said to his friend, &ldquo;If
I shall make up my mind to go to some place where
there is great danger, I shall go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His friend said, &ldquo;I will go with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Running Chief thought again, and at last he said,
&ldquo;On account of my feelings I have decided to go into
the camp of my enemies, and be eaten by their dogs.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>52]</a></span>
The other man said, &ldquo;Whatever you have determined
on I also will do.&rdquo;</p>


<h4>IV.</h4>

<p>Then they jumped up out of the hole they were
hiding in, and tied up their waists, and prepared to
start. They were not very far from a trail which
connected two villages, along which persons kept
passing, and the Indians of these villages were all
about them. When they jumped up to go toward
the trail, they saw four or five persons passing at a
little distance. When they saw these people, Running
Chief called out to them, &ldquo;<i>High&mdash;eigh</i>,&rdquo; and
made motions for them to come to him. He wanted
to show his strong will, and that on account of his
bad feelings he wished to have his troubles ended
right there. He called to them twice, and each time
the Indians stopped and looked at the Pawnees, and
then went on. They did not know who it was that
was calling them; perhaps they thought the Pawnees
were two squaws.</p>

<p>The two young men went out to the trail and followed
these persons toward the village. They went
over a little hill, and as soon as they had come to the
top and looked over it, they saw the village. On this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>53]</a></span>
side of it, and nearest to them were three lodges. At
the foot of the hill was a river, which they must cross
to come to these three lodges. When they came to
the river, the friend asked; &ldquo;Shall we take off our
moccasins and leggings to cross?&rdquo; Running Chief
replied, &ldquo;Why should I take off my moccasins and
leggings when I know that my life is just going over
a precipice? Let us go in as we are.&rdquo; So they
crossed with moccasins and leggings on. The river
was only half-leg deep.</p>

<p>Just as they reached the further bank, all on a
sudden, it came over Running Chief what they were
doing&mdash;that they were going to certain death. All
his courage seemed to leave him, and he felt as if he
had no bones in his body. Then for a moment he
faltered; but he could not give up now. He felt
that if he was a man he must go forward; he could
not turn back. He stopped for an instant; and his
friend looked at him, and said, &ldquo;Come, let us hurry
on. We are near the lodges.&rdquo; He stepped forward
then, but his feet seemed to be heavy and to drag on
the ground. He walked as if he were asleep.</p>

<p>There was no one about near at hand, and as they
went forward Running Chief prayed with all his
mind to <i>Ti-ra&acute;-wa</i> that no one might come until they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>54]</a></span>
had reached the lodge, and had got inside. When
they had got to within about one hundred yards of
the lodge, a little boy came out, and began to play
around the door, and when they were about fifty
yards from him he saw them. As soon as he looked
at them, he knew that they did not belong to the
camp, and he gave a kind of a scream and darted
into the lodge, but no one came out. The people
within paid no attention to the boy. As they walked
toward the lodges Running Chief seemed not to
know where he was, but to be walking in a dream.
He thought of nothing except his longing to get to
this lodge.</p>

<p>They went to the largest of the three lodges.
Running Chief raised the door and put his head in,
and as he did so, it seemed as if his breath stopped.
He went in and sat down far back in the lodge,
opposite the entrance, and though his breath was
stopped, his heart was beating like a drum. His
friend had followed him in, and sat down beside
him. Both had their bows in their hands, strung,
and a sheaf of arrows.</p>

<p>When they entered the lodge, the man who was
lying down at the back of the lodge uttered a loud
exclamation, &ldquo;<i>Woof</i>,&rdquo; and then seemed struck dumb.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>55]</a></span>
A plate of corn mush had just been handed him, but
he did not take it, and it sat there on the ground by
him. One woman was just raising a buffalo horn
spoon of mush to her mouth, but her hand stopped
before reaching it, and she stared at them, holding
the mush before her face. Another woman was
ladling some mush into a plate, and she held the
plate in one hand and the ladle above it, and looked
at them without moving. They all seemed turned
into stone.</p>

<p>As the two Pawnees sat there, Running Chief&rsquo;s
breath suddenly came back to him. Before it had
all been dark about him, as if he had been asleep;
but now the clouds had cleared away, and he could
see the road ahead of him. Now he felt a man, and
brave. As he looked around him, and saw the man
lying motionless, and one woman just ready to take
a mouthful, and the other woman with the ladle held
over the dish, he perceived that they could not move,
they were so astonished.</p>

<p>At length the Wichita had come to his senses.
He drew a long breath, and sat up, and for a while
looked at the two Pawnees. Then he made some
sign to them which they did not understand, but
they guessed that he was trying to ask who they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>56]</a></span>
were. Running Chief struck his breast, and said,
&ldquo;<i>Pi-ta&acute;-da</i>&rdquo; (Pawnee). As soon as the Wichita
heard that he caught his breath, and heaved a long
sigh. He did not know what to think of two Pawnees
coming into his lodge. He could not think
what it meant. He drew a long breath. He did
not touch his plate of food, but motioned a woman
to take it away. Presently he called to some one in
the neighboring lodge. He was answered, and in a
moment a man came in. He called again, and another
entered, and the three looked for a long time
at the two Pawnees. These were sitting motionless,
but watching like two wildcats to see what was going
to happen. Each had his bow and arrows by his
side, and his knife inside his robe. At length the
owner of the lodge spoke, and one of the men went
out, and after a little they heard the sound of horses&rsquo;
hoofs coming, and they supposed some one was riding
up. Every now and then Running Chief would
touch his friend&rsquo;s knee with his own, as if to say,
&ldquo;Watch.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The owner of the lodge made a sign and pointed
to the east and said &ldquo;<i>Capitan</i>.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> At the same time
he was dressing himself up, putting on a pair of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>57]</a></span>
officer&rsquo;s trousers and a uniform coat. Meantime the
Pawnees heard the rattle of one saddle, and then of
another. The Wichita chief put on his blanket, and
his pistol belt around it, and then made signs for
them to go out. He led the way, and the Pawnees
followed. As they went, Running Chief touched his
friend, as if to say, &ldquo;Watch. They may shoot us as
we go out.&rdquo; But when they looked out of the lodge,
the Wichita was walking toward the horses, so there
was no danger. He mounted a horse, and signed to
Running Chief to get up behind him. Another man
mounted the other horse, and the friend got up
behind him.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_2_2" id="Footnote_2_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a>
A Spanish word meaning chief.</p>
</div>

<p>As they rode toward the main village, it came into
the mind of Running Chief to kill the man he was
riding behind, and to ride away. There was where
he had to fight his hardest battle. He was tempted
to kill this man in front of him, but he was not overpowered
by this temptation. He overcame it. He
thought that perhaps he might be mounted on a
poor horse, and even if he did kill this man and his
friend the other, they might be on slow horses and
be caught at once. Every little while he would look
at his friend and roll his eyes, as if to say, &ldquo;Watch
on your side and I will watch on mine.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>58]</a></span>
As he came near to the village, the Wichita warrior
called out, and began to sing a song, and all
at once the village was in an uproar. The men,
women and children seemed to start up out of the
ground, and the lodges poured forth their inmates.
Running Chief felt that he was in danger, but he
knew that he was not in as much danger as the man
before him. He could take the pistol out of the belt
that he had hold of and kill him, or he could use his
own knife. The Wichita knew that he was in danger.
He knew that he was in the power of the enemy.</p>

<p>After the Wichita had called out to the people
that they had enemies with them, he kept on talking,
saying, &ldquo;Keep quiet. Do not do anything. Wait.
Keep away from me and be still. I am in danger.&rdquo;
They would not have listened to him, if it had not
been that he was a leading man, and a brave warrior.
The riders came to the largest lodge, which stood
in the middle of the village. Here they stopped.
When Running Chief got off the horse, he held tightly
the belt of the Wichita, who dismounted; and they
went together into the lodge of the Head Chief, and
the others followed and went in, and all sat down
opposite the door. All this time there was a hubbub
outside. People were flying from their lodges to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>59]</a></span>
that of the Head Chief, and lifting up the edge of
the lodge, and peeping under it at the Pawnees.
They chattered to each other, and called out to
those who were coming; all was noise and confusion.</p>


<h4>V.</h4>

<p>The under chiefs came in one by one, until all
were present. Then one of them made a speech,
saying that it would be best to leave everything to
the Head Chief, and that he should decide what
ought to be done with these enemies. Then it was
silent for a time, while the Chief was making up his
mind what should be done; and during this silence
Running Chief felt a touch on his shoulder, and
looked behind him, and there was handed to him
under the edge of the lodge a dish of meat. He
took it and began to eat, and his companion also
ate with him. After he had eaten a few mouthfuls,
he took his arrows, which he had held in his hand,
and put them in his quiver, and unstrung his bow
and laid it aside, and his friend did the same.</p>

<p>Then the Chief stood up and spoke to those sitting
there and said, &ldquo;What can I do? They have
eaten of my food. I cannot make war on people
who have been eating with me.&rdquo; While he was saying
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>60]</a></span>
this, Running Chief was again touched on the
shoulder, and some one handed him a cup of water,
and he drank; and the Chief, as he saw this, added,
&ldquo;and have also drunk of my water.&rdquo; He then
turned and called to a certain man, who could
speak Pawnee, and told him to ask these men if
they were on the warpath. He asked them, &ldquo;Are
you on the warpath?&rdquo; and they replied, &ldquo;Yes, we
are on the warpath.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then said he, &ldquo;What are you here for?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Running Chief answered, &ldquo;You have plenty of
dogs. I am here that my body may be eaten by
them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When the Wichitas heard this they all made a
sound, <i>Ah-h-h-h!</i> for they were surprised at his
bravery. The Chief asked him, &ldquo;Do you know
anything about the horses that were missed last
night?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He said, &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where are they?&rdquo; said the Head Chief.</p>

<p>Running Chief replied, &ldquo;The party have gone off
with them&mdash;Pawnees.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Were you with them?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I was with them, and I stopped behind on
purpose to come into your village.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>61]</a></span>
The Head Chief then turned to the others and
talked for a little while. He said, &ldquo;See what a
brave man this is. He had resolved to die. But he
shall not die, because he has eaten our food and
drunk of our water. Although we are enemies of
this man&rsquo;s tribe, yet we are the same people with
them, who have been apart for a long time. I cannot
help it; my heart is touched by his talk and by their
bravery. By their bravery they are safe.&rdquo; And all
the Wichitas said &ldquo;<i>Waugh</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then the Head Chief through the interpreter
talked to Running Chief. He said, &ldquo;Are you a
chief?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Running Chief replied, &ldquo;No, I am not a chief; I
am like a dog; I am poor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Head Chief said to him, &ldquo;By your bravery
you have saved yourselves. You shall have the road
to your home made white before you. Let there not
be one blood spot on it.&rdquo; Then he turned to those
who were sitting about the lodge and said, &ldquo;Now,
my young men, do something for them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A young man named Crazy Wolf stood up and
spoke; and when he had finished, the interpreter
said, &ldquo;That man has given you a black horse, the
best that he has.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>62]</a></span>
Another young man on the other side of the lodge
spoke, and the interpreter said, &ldquo;He has given you
a roan horse, the best that he has.&rdquo; Then all the
Wichitas began to speak at once, and before they
knew it, the Pawnees had ten head of horses, and
robes and blankets, saddles, bridles, shields, spears
and moccasins&mdash;many beautiful presents. So they
were well provided.</p>

<p>The Head Chief again stood up and talked to the
assembly, praising these Pawnees; and he stepped
over to Running Chief and shook hands with him,
and when he did so, Running Chief stood up and
put his arms around the Chief and pressed him to his
breast, and the Chief did the same to him, and when
Running Chief had his arms around the Chief, the
Chief trembled, and came near to crying. The Chief
embraced the other Pawnee, and looked him in the
face and said, &ldquo;What brave men you are!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The friend said, &ldquo;What my friend stepped, that I
stepped; I trod in his footprints; I had one mind
with him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As the Chief stepped back to his place he spoke
through the interpreter, &ldquo;Now you have eaten of my
food and drunk of my water. Everything that I
have is yours. My women and my children are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>63]</a></span>
yours. You are not a chief, but you are a chief.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
Then he spoke to the crowd and they all went away,
leaving only the principal men in the lodge.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_3_3" id="Footnote_3_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3_3"><span class="label">[3]</span></a>
You are not a chief, but you have made yourself a chief by
your great qualities.</p>
</div>

<p>That afternoon the Pawnees were feasted everywhere,
and had to eat till they were almost dead;
and as they went about, all of their former sadness
seemed to be swept away, and Running Chief felt
like crying for joy.</p>

<p>While they were feasting, the man who had given
the black horse went out, and caught it up, and
painted it handsomely, and rode into the village, and
put on it a silver bridle, and eagle feathers in its
mane and tail, and when Running Chief was going
from one lodge to another he met him, and jumped
off the horse and said, &ldquo;Brother, ride this.&rdquo; He gave
him also a shield and a spear.</p>

<p>These Pawnees staid two months with the Wichitas,
and all their troubles seemed at an end. At length
Running Chief called a council of the chiefs, and
told them that now he wished to make ready to go
home to his village. He thanked them for all that
they had done for him, and said that now he would
go. The chiefs said, &ldquo;It is well. We are glad that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>64]</a></span>
you have been with us and visited us. Take the
good news back to your tribe. Tell them that we are
one people, though long separated. Let the road
between our villages be made white. Let it no more
show any spots of blood.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Running Chief thanked them and said, &ldquo;I will go
and take the good news to my people. I shall show
them the presents you have made us, and tell them
how well we have been treated. It may be that some
of the chiefs of my tribe will wish to come down to
visit you, as I have done.&rdquo; The Head Chief said,
&ldquo;Can I rely on your words, that I shall be visited?&rdquo;
Running Chief replied, &ldquo;You can rely on them if I
have to come alone to visit you again.&rdquo; The Chief
got up and put his arms about him, and said, &ldquo;I
want to be visited. Let there be no more war
between us. We are brothers; let us always be
brothers.&rdquo; Then they gave him many more presents,
and packed his horses, and six braves offered to go
with him through the Cheyenne country. They went
through in the night. Running Chief said afterward,
&ldquo;I could have stolen a lot of horses from the Cheyennes,
but I thought, I will be coming back through
this country and it is better not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At the Pawnee village these two young men had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>65]</a></span>
been mourned by their relations as lost or dead. It
was in the spring (March, 1869) when they reached
home, and there was joy in the tribe when they came
in with the presents. Running Chief was praised,
and so was his friend. Both had been brave and had
done great things.</p>

<p>Now Running Chief&rsquo;s name was changed from
<i>Wi-ti-ti le-shar&acute;-uspi</i> to <i>Sk&#365;r&acute;-ar-a le-shar</i> (Lone
Chief).</p>


<h4>VI.</h4>

<p>The following summer in August, at the close of
the summer hunt, three hundred Pawnees, old men
and young, under the leadership of Lone Chief,
visited the Wichitas, who received them well, and
gave them many horses. Lone Chief was not satisfied
with the peace that he had made with the
Wichitas. He also visited the Kiowas, and made
peace, and was given by them eight fine horses. He
also led his party to the Comanches, and visited
them, and got many presents. In the fall the Pawnees
returned to their village. Many of them fell
sick on the way, and some died.</p>

<p>In the winter of 1869-70 Lone Chief and his friend
led a war party against the Cheyennes. They took
six hundred head of horses. The Cheyennes now
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>66]</a></span>
tell us that in the seventy-five lodges of that camp
there was not left a hoof. All night and all next day
they ran the herd. Then Lone Chief said, &ldquo;Let us
not run the horses any longer, they will not come
after us; they are afoot.&rdquo; When the party got on
the north side of the Republican, on the table lands,
a terrible storm of snow and wind came upon them,
and they were nearly lost. For three days and three
nights they lay in the storm. All were frozen, some
losing toes and fingers. They survived, however,
and brought in all their horses. Again Lone Chief
sacrificed to <i>Ti-ra&acute;-wa</i>. A second sacrifice is very
unusual and a notable event.</p>

<h3>THE PRISONERS OF COURT
HOUSE ROCK.</h3>


<p><span class="dropcap">C</span>OURT HOUSE ROCK is a high, square-shaped
bluff, or butte, on the North Platte
River. It is composed of a hard, yellowish clay,
which is but slowly eroded by the weather, though
soft enough to be cut readily with a knife. On all
sides except one, this rock or butte is nearly or quite
vertical, and its sides, smoothed and polished by the
wind and the rain, offer no projecting points, to
serve as foot or hand holds for one who might wish
to climb up or down. On one side there is a way by
which an active man may reach the summit, where
he finds a flat tableland of moderate extent.</p>

<p>A number of years ago a war party of Skidi, who
were camped near Court House Rock, were surprised
by a party of Sioux. There were many of them, and
they drove the Skidi back, and at length these were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>68]</a></span>
obliged to climb the steep side of Court House Rock.
The Sioux dared not follow them up on to the rock,
but guarded the only place where it was possible to
come down, and camped all around the rock below
to starve the Skidi out. The Skidi had nothing to
eat nor to drink, and suffered terribly from hunger
and still more from thirst. The leader of the party
suffered most of any, for he thought that he would
surely lose all his men. He felt that this was the
worst of all. He must not only die, but must also be
disgraced, because under his leadership the young
men of his party had been lost. He used to go off
at night, apart from the others, and pray to <i>Ti-ra&acute;-wa</i>
for help; for some way to save his party.</p>

<p>One night while he was praying, something spoke
to him, and said, &ldquo;Look hard for a place where you
may get down from this rock, and so save both your
men and yourself.&rdquo; He kept on praying that night,
and when day came, he looked all along the edge of
the rock for a place where it might be possible to get
down. At last he found near the edge of the cliff a
point of the soft clay rock sticking up above the level
of the rest. The side of the rock below it was straight
up and down, and smooth. At night he took his
knife, and began to cut about the base of this point
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>69]</a></span>
of rock, and night after night he kept at this until he
had cut away the base of the point, so that it was no
larger around than a man&rsquo;s body. Then he secretly
took all the lariats that the party had, and tied them
together, and let them down, and found that his rope
was long enough to reach the ground. He put the
rope around the point, and made a loop in it for his
feet, and slowly let himself down to the ground. He
got there safely, and then climbed back again. The
next night he called his men about him, and told
them how it was, and that they might all be saved.
Then he ordered the youngest and least important
man of the party to let himself down, and after him
the next youngest, and so on, up to the more important
men, and last of all the leader&rsquo;s turn came.
He let himself down, and they all crept through the
Sioux camp and escaped.</p>

<p>They never knew how long the Sioux stayed there
watching the rock. Probably until they thought
that the Skidi had all starved to death.</p>

<h3>WOLVES IN THE NIGHT.</h3>


<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>N the year 1879 Little Warrior, with a Chaui boy
and a soldier, was off scouting on the plains east
of the mountains. They saw a long way off&mdash;perhaps
twenty miles&mdash;some objects that seemed to be
moving. It was one of those hot dry days in summer,
when all the air is quivering and all things are
distorted by the mirage. They watched these objects
through their glasses for a long time. They seemed
to move and quiver, and they could not tell what
they were, but Little Warrior thought they were
mounted men. They seemed to be traveling in the
same direction with this scouting party. At length
they could see that they were mounted men, and
were driving some loose animals.</p>

<p>When night came, the two Pawnees left their
horses with the soldier and started on foot to look
for the camp of the strangers, and to find out who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>71]</a></span>
they were. They formed the plan to make themselves
look like coyotes, so that they could go close
to the camp. Each took from under his saddle a
white sheet, which, when the time came, they would
tie around their bodies, having their guns inside,
held under their arms, and their pistols in their belts
about their waists. It was a bright moonlight night,
the moon being so bright that it made it hard to see
far on the prairie.</p>

<p>The camp was found in a little hollow, and was
occupied by seven Ute Indians. They had a dog
with them. The Pawnees could hear them talking
and laughing, as they sat about the big fire they had
built. They could see the horses too.</p>

<p>The men put on their white sheets, and getting
down on all fours, prowled about like wolves, gradually
drawing nearer and nearer to the camp. Two
or three times the dog smelt them and barked, but
they paid no attention to it, but trotted hither and
thither, smelling the ground and sometimes sitting
up on their haunches like wolves, and then going on
again. After a little while they came so close to the
camp that they could see that the horses were staked
out, and that there were some mules feeding about,
hobbled. One of the Utes, who noticed the wolves
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>72]</a></span>
prowling near the camp, got his gun and shot at the
Chaui boy, but he did not hit him. The boy loped
off and joined Little Warrior behind a hill, and there
the two waited.</p>

<p>Little Warrior said to his companion, &ldquo;These men
have come far to-day. They are pretty tired. Wait
and they will lie down and go to sleep.&rdquo; Presently
the camp quieted down and the Utes slept.</p>

<p>The Pawnees then made themselves wolves again,
and went close to the Ute camp. The horses were
staked close to where the men were sleeping, but
the mules had wandered off a little to one side. Six
mules were together, and one was by itself on the
other side of the camp. Little Warrior went around
the camp to this one, and cut its hobbles, and then
drove it slowly toward the others. Then they drove
the whole seven quietly away from the camp. If it
had not been for the dog, they could very likely have
stolen the horses too, and left the Utes afoot, and
perhaps they might have been able to kill the Utes.</p>

<p>They drove the mules about two miles, and then
went on to where they had left their horses. They
found the soldier nearly frightened to death. He
said he did not like to be left by himself in such a
lonely place; he wanted to go to camp. They told
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>73]</a></span>
him they were going to return and get those mules.
They did so, and secured them, and drove them in
to their own camp, which they reached about six
o&rsquo;clock the next morning.</p>

<p>It was learned afterward that fourteen mules had
been stolen from a Government train, and a reward
of $200 had been offered for their recovery. These
taken by the two Pawnees were seven of the stolen
animals, and each of the men received $50 as his
proportion of the reward.</p>

<h3>A LEADER OF SOLDIERS.</h3>


<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>N 1876, when the attack was made by General
Mackenzie on the village of the Cheyenne chief,
Dull Knife, the Pawnee Scouts charged down on the
village on the south side of the creek, while on the
north side of the stream, a company of United States
cavalry, under Lieut. McKinney, were making a
charge. Before the village was reached, Ralph J.
Weeks, an educated Pawnee, and some others of the
scouts crossed the stream and were riding near the
soldiers. As they were crossing the ca&ntilde;on at the
mouth of which the village stood, the enemy began
to fire at them from the ravine. Lieut. McKinney
was killed at the first volley, and immediately afterward
his first sergeant fell, leaving the troop without
a commander. The soldiers hesitated, stopped, and
then turned round, and began to retreat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>75]</a></span>
Ralph rode up behind them, and got off his horse,
and called out, &ldquo;Hold on boys, don&rsquo;t run. There
are only seven Indians there. Come on, and we will
kill them all. Get off your horses and come ahead
on foot. There are only seven of them. We will
kill them all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The men stopped in their retreat, dismounted, and
under Ralph&rsquo;s direction and leadership, went forward,
and did kill all the Indians in the ravine.</p>

<h3>A CHEYENNE BLANKET.</h3>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE Cheyennes, like other Indians, do not
speak to each other when they are away
from the camp. If a man goes away from the village,
and sits or stands by himself on the top of a
hill, it is a sign that he wants to be alone; perhaps
to meditate; perhaps to pray. No one speaks to
him or goes near him.</p>

<p>Now, there was once a Pawnee boy, who went off
on the warpath to the Cheyenne camp. In some
way he had obtained a Cheyenne blanket. This
Pawnee came close to the Cheyenne camp, and
hid himself there to wait. About the middle of
the afternoon, he left his hiding place, and walked
to the top of the hill overlooking the village. He
had his Cheyenne blanket wrapped about him and
over his head, with only a little hole for his eyes.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>77]</a></span>
He stood there for an hour or two, looking over the
Cheyenne camp.</p>

<p>They were coming in from buffalo hunting, and
some were leading in the pack horses loaded down
with meat. A man came along, riding a horse
packed with meat, and leading another pack horse,
and a black spotted horse that was his running
horse. These running horses are ridden only on
the chase or on war parties, and are well cared for.
After being used they are taken down to the river
and are washed and cleaned with care. When the
boy saw this spotted horse, he thought to himself
that this was the horse that he would take. When
the man who was leading it reached his lodge, he
dismounted and handed the ropes to his women,
and went inside.</p>

<p>Then the Pawnee made up his mind what he
would do. He started down the hill into the village,
and walked straight to this lodge where the women
were unloading the meat. He walked up to them,
reached out his hand, and took the ropes of the
spotted horse and one of the others. As he did so
the women fell back. Probably they thought that
this was some one of the relations of the owner, who
was going to take the running horse down to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>78]</a></span>
river to wash it. The Pawnee could not talk Cheyenne,
but as he turned away he mumbled something&mdash;<i>m-m-m-m</i>&mdash;as
if speaking in a low voice, and then
walked down toward the river. As soon as he had
gone down over the bank and was out of sight, he
jumped on the spotted horse and rode into the
brush, and pretty soon was away with two horses,
stolen out of the Cheyenne camp in broad daylight.</p>

<h3>LITTLE WARRIOR&rsquo;S COUNSEL.</h3>


<p><span class="dropcap">M</span>OST of the Pawnee heroes are so regarded
because of victories, daring deeds, the <i>coups</i>
they have counted and the horses they have stolen.
The glory of Comanche Chief and of Lone Chief
depends mainly on their bravery, rather than on the
fact that they were peace-makers. Yet there should
be room among these stories for the account of an
educated Pawnee&mdash;a brave&mdash;who by his wise counsel
to an Indian of a hostile tribe saved many lives, both
of Indians and of white men. Little Warrior was
educated at a Western college, but has shown his
bravery on the field of battle, and has sacrificed a
scalp to <i>Ti-ra&acute;-wa</i>.</p>

<p>In the year 1879, at the time of the Ute outbreak,
after Major Thornburgh&rsquo;s command had been annihilated,
Little Warrior was employed as a scout for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>80]</a></span>
the troops. On the headwaters of the Arkansas
River he was one day scouting in advance of the
command, in company with four white soldiers and
four Indian scouts. One day, the party saw far off
on the prairie an Indian, who showed a white flag,
and came toward them. When he had come near to
them, the soldiers proposed to kill him, and report
that he was a Ute, one of the Indians that they were
looking for. But Little Warrior said, &ldquo;No. He has
a white flag up, and it may be that he is carrying a
dispatch, or, perhaps, he is a white man disguised as
an Indian.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When the man had come close to them, they saw
that he was dressed like a Comanche; he did not
have the bristling fringe of hair over the forehead
that the Utes wear, and his side locks were unbraided.
Little Warrior asked him, by signs, if he
was alone, to which he replied in the same language
that he was alone. Then Little Warrior inquired
who he was. The stranger made the sign for
Comanche&mdash;a friendly tribe.</p>

<p>They took him into the camp, and after a while
Little Warrior began to talk to him in Comanche.
He could not understand a word of it.</p>

<p>Then the Pawnee said to him, &ldquo;My friend, you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>81]</a></span>
are a Ute.&rdquo; The stranger acknowledged that he
was.</p>

<p>Then Little Warrior talked to him, and gave him
much good advice. He said, &ldquo;My friend, you and I
have the same skin, and what I tell you now is for
your good. I speak to you as a friend, and what I
say to you now is so that you may save your women
and your children. It is of no use for you to try to
fight the white people. I have been among them,
and I know how many they are. They are like the
grass. Even if you were to kill a hundred it would
be nothing. It would be like burning up a few
handfuls of prairie grass. There would be just as
many left. If you try to fight them they will hunt
you like a ghost. Wherever you go they will follow
after you, and you will get no rest. The soldiers
will be continually on your tracks. Even if
you were to go up on top of a high mountain, where
there was nothing but rocks, and where no one else
could come, the soldiers would follow you, and get
around you, and wait, and wait, even for fifty years.
They would have plenty to eat, and they could wait
until after you were dead. There is one white man
who is the chief of all this country, and what he says
must be done. It is no use to fight him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>82]</a></span>
&ldquo;Now if you are wise you will go out and get all
your people, and bring them in, on to the reservation,
and give yourself up. It will be better for you in the
end. I speak to you as a friend, because we are
both the same color, and I hope that you will listen
to my words.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Ute said, &ldquo;My friend, your words are good,
and I thank you for the friendly advice you have
given me. I will follow it and will agree to go away
and bring in my people.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Little Warrior said, &ldquo;How do you make a promise?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Ute said, &ldquo;By raising the right hand to one
above.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Little Warrior said, &ldquo;That is the custom also
among my people.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Ute raised his hand and made the promise.</p>

<p>After he had been detained two or three weeks, he
was allowed to go, and about a month afterward, he
brought in the band of which he was chief, and surrendered.
Through his influence afterward, the
whole tribe came in and gave themselves up. He
was grateful to Little Warrior for what he had done
for him, and told him that if he ever came back into
his country he would give him many ponies.</p>

<h3>A COMANCHE BUNDLE.</h3>


<p><span class="dropcap">A</span> PAWNEE boy went to the Comanche village
after horses. At night he went into the camp,
crept to the door of a lodge, and took a horse that
was tied there. It was bright moonlight, and as he
was cutting the rope he saw, hanging before the
lodge, a handsome shield and a spear, which he
took. There was also a bundle hanging there. He
took this down, opened it, and found in it a war
bonnet, beaded moccasins and leggings, and a breast-plate
of long beads. He dressed himself in all these
fine things, mounted the horse and rode away.</p>

<h3>THE DUN HORSE.</h3>


<h4>I.</h4>

<p><span class="dropcap">M</span>ANY years ago, there lived in the Pawnee
tribe an old woman and her grandson, a
boy about sixteen years old. These people had
no relations and were very poor. They were so
poor that they were despised by the rest of the tribe.
They had nothing of their own; and always, after
the village started to move the camp from one place
to another, these two would stay behind the rest, to
look over the old camp, and pick up anything that
the other Indians had thrown away, as worn out or
useless. In this way they would sometimes get
pieces of robes, worn out moccasins with holes in
them, and bits of meat.</p>

<p>Now, it happened one day, after the tribe had
moved away from the camp, that this old woman
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>88]</a></span>
and her boy were following along the trail behind
the rest, when they came to a miserable old worn
out dun horse, which they supposed had been abandoned
by some Indians. He was thin and exhausted,
was blind of one eye, had a bad sore back, and one
of his forelegs was very much swollen. In fact,
he was so worthless that none of the Pawnees had
been willing to take the trouble to try to drive him
along with them. But when the old woman and her
boy came along, the boy said, &ldquo;Come now, we will
take this old horse, for we can make him carry our
pack.&rdquo; So the old woman put her pack on the horse,
and drove him along, but he limped and could only
go very slowly.</p>


<h4>II.</h4>

<p>The tribe moved up on the North Platte, until
they came to Court House Rock. The two poor
Indians followed them, and camped with the others.
One day while they were here, the young men who
had been sent out to look for buffalo, came hurrying
into camp and told the chiefs that a large herd of
buffalo were near, and that among them was a
spotted calf.</p>

<p>The Head Chief of the Pawnees had a very beautiful
daughter, and when he heard about the spotted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>89]</a></span>
calf, he ordered his old crier to go about through the
village, and call out that the man who killed the
spotted calf should have his daughter for his wife.
For a spotted robe is <i>ti-war&acute;-uks-ti</i>&mdash;big medicine.</p>

<p>The buffalo were feeding about four miles from
the village, and the chiefs decided that the charge
should be made from there. In this way, the man
who had the fastest horse would be the most likely
to kill the calf. Then all the warriors and the young
men picked out their best and fastest horses, and
made ready to start. Among those who prepared
for the charge was the poor boy on the old dun
horse. But when they saw him, all the rich young
braves on their fast horses pointed at him, and said,
&ldquo;Oh, see; there is the horse that is going to catch
the spotted calf;&rdquo; and they laughed at him, so that
the poor boy was ashamed, and rode off to one side
of the crowd, where he could not hear their jokes
and laughter.</p>

<p>When he had ridden off some little way, the horse
stopped, and turned his head round, and spoke to
the boy. He said, &ldquo;Take me down to the creek,
and plaster me all over with mud. Cover my head
and neck and body and legs.&rdquo; When the boy heard
the horse speak, he was afraid; but he did as he was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>90]</a></span>
told. Then the horse said, &ldquo;Now mount, but do
not ride back to the warriors, who laugh at you because
you have such a poor horse. Stay right here,
until the word is given to charge.&rdquo; So the boy
stayed there.</p>

<p>And presently all the fine horses were drawn up in
line and pranced about, and were so eager to go that
their riders could hardly hold them in; and at last
the old crier gave the word, &ldquo;<i>Loo-ah</i>&rdquo;&mdash;Go! Then
the Pawnees all leaned forward on their horses and
yelled, and away they went. Suddenly, away off to
the right, was seen the old dun horse. He did not
seem to run. He seemed to sail along like a bird.
He passed all the fastest horses, and in a moment he
was among the buffalo. First he picked out the
spotted calf, and charging up alongside of it, <i>U-ra-rish!</i>
straight flew the arrow. The calf fell. The
boy drew another arrow, and killed a fat cow that
was running by. Then he dismounted and began to
skin the calf, before any of the other warriors had
come up. But when the rider got off the old dun
horse, how changed he was! He pranced about and
would hardly stand still near the dead buffalo. His
back was all right again; his legs were well and fine;
and both his eyes were clear and bright.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>91]</a></span>
The boy skinned the calf and the cow that he had
killed, and then he packed all the meat on the horse,
and put the spotted robe on top of the load, and
started back to the camp on foot, leading the dun
horse. But even with this heavy load the horse
pranced all the time, and was scared at everything
he saw. On the way to camp, one of the rich young
chiefs of the tribe rode up by the boy, and offered
him twelve good horses for the spotted robe, so that
he could marry the Head Chief&rsquo;s beautiful daughter;
but the boy laughed at him and would not sell the robe.</p>

<p>Now, while the boy walked to the camp leading
the dun horse, most of the warriors rode back, and
one of those that came first to the village, went to
the old woman, and said to her, &ldquo;Your grandson has
killed the spotted calf.&rdquo; And the old woman said,
&ldquo;Why do you come to tell me this? You ought to
be ashamed to make fun of my boy, because he is
poor.&rdquo; The warrior said, &ldquo;What I have told you is
true,&rdquo; and then he rode away. After a little while
another brave rode up to the old woman, and said
to her, &ldquo;Your grandson has killed the spotted calf.&rdquo;
Then the old woman began to cry, she felt so badly
because every one made fun of her boy, because he
was poor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>92]</a></span>
Pretty soon the boy came along, leading the horse
up to the lodge where he and his grandmother lived.
It was a little lodge, just big enough for two, and was
made of old pieces of skin that the old woman had
picked up, and was tied together with strings of rawhide
and sinew. It was the meanest and worst lodge
in the village. When the old woman saw her boy
leading the dun horse with the load of meat and the
robes on it, she was very much surprised. The boy
said to her, &ldquo;Here, I have brought you plenty of
meat to eat, and here is a robe, that you may have
for yourself. Take the meat off the horse.&rdquo; Then
the old woman laughed, for her heart was glad.
But when she went to take the meat from the horse&rsquo;s
back, he snorted and jumped about, and acted like a
wild horse. The old woman looked at him in wonder,
and could hardly believe that it was the same
horse. So the boy had to take off the meat, for the
horse would not let the old woman come near him.</p>


<h4>III.</h4>

<p>That night the horse spoke again to the boy and
said, &ldquo;<i>Wa-ti-hes Chah&acute;-ra-rat wa-ta</i>. To-morrow
the Sioux are coming&mdash;a large war party. They will
attack the village, and you will have a great battle.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>93]</a></span>
Now, when the Sioux are drawn up in line of battle,
and are all ready to fight, you jump on to me, and
ride as hard as you can, right into the middle of the
Sioux, and up to their Head Chief, their greatest
warrior, and count <i>coup</i> on him, and kill him, and
then ride back. Do this four times, and count <i>coup</i>
on four of the bravest Sioux, and kill them, but don&rsquo;t
go again. If you go the fifth time, may be you will
be killed, or else you will lose me. <i>La-ku&acute;-ta-chix</i>&mdash;remember.&rdquo;
So the boy promised.</p>

<p>The next day it happened as the horse had said,
and the Sioux came down and formed a line of
battle. Then the boy took his bow and arrows, and
jumped on the dun horse, and charged into the
midst of them. And when the Sioux saw that he
was going to strike their Head Chief, they all shot
their arrows at him, and the arrows flew so thickly
across each other that the sky became dark, but none
of them hit the boy. And he counted <i>coup</i> on the
Chief, and killed him, and then rode back. After
that he charged again among the Sioux, where they
were gathered thickest, and counted <i>coup</i> on their
bravest warrior, and killed him. And then twice
more, until he had gone four times as the horse had
told him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>94]</a></span>
But the Sioux and the Pawnees kept on fighting,
and the boy stood around and watched the battle.
And at last he said to himself, &ldquo;I have been four
times and have killed four Sioux, and I am all right,
I am not hurt anywhere; why may I not go again?&rdquo;
So he jumped on the dun horse, and charged again.
But when he got among the Sioux, one Sioux warrior
drew an arrow and shot. The arrow struck the
dun horse behind the forelegs and pierced him
through. And the horse fell down dead. But the
boy jumped off, and fought his way through the
Sioux, and ran away as fast as he could to the Pawnees.
Now, as soon as the horse was killed, the
Sioux said to each other, &ldquo;This horse was like a
man. He was brave. He was not like a horse.&rdquo;
And they took their knives and hatchets, and hacked
the dun horse and gashed his flesh, and cut him into
small pieces.</p>

<p>The Pawnees and Sioux fought all day long, but
toward night the Sioux broke and fled.</p>


<h4>IV.</h4>

<p>The boy felt very badly that he had lost his horse;
and, after the fight was over, he went out from the
village to where it had taken place, to mourn for his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>95]</a></span>
horse. He went to the spot where the horse lay, and
gathered up all the pieces of flesh, which the Sioux
had cut off, and the legs and the hoofs, and put them
all together in a pile. Then he went off to the top
of a hill near by, and sat down and drew his robe
over his head, and began to mourn for his horse.</p>

<p>As he sat there, he heard a great wind storm coming
up, and it passed over him with a loud rushing
sound, and after the wind came a rain. The boy
looked down from where he sat to the pile of flesh
and bones, which was all that was left of his horse,
and he could just see it through the rain. And the
rain passed by, and his heart was very heavy, and he
kept on mourning.</p>

<p>And pretty soon, came another rushing wind, and
after it a rain; and as he looked through the driving
rain toward the spot where the pieces lay, he thought
that they seemed to come together and take shape,
and that the pile looked like a horse lying down, but
he could not see well for the thick rain.</p>

<p>After this, came a third storm like the others; and
now when he looked toward the horse he thought he
saw its tail move from side to side two or three times,
and that it lifted its head from the ground. The boy
was afraid, and wanted to run away, but he stayed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>96]</a></span>
And as he waited, there came another storm. And
while the rain fell, looking through the rain, the boy
saw the horse raise himself up on his forelegs and
look about. Then the dun horse stood up.</p>


<h4>V.</h4>

<p>The boy left the place where he had been sitting
on the hilltop, and went down to him. When
the boy had come near to him, the horse spoke and
said, &ldquo;You have seen how it has been this day; and
from this you may know how it will be after this.
But <i>Ti-ra&acute;-wa</i> has been good, and has let me come
back to you. After this, do what I tell you; not any
more, not any less.&rdquo; Then the horse said, &ldquo;Now
lead me off, far away from the camp, behind that
big hill, and leave me there to-night, and in the
morning come for me;&rdquo; and the boy did as he was
told.</p>

<p>And when he went for the horse in the morning,
he found with him a beautiful white gelding, much
more handsome than any horse in the tribe. That
night the dun horse told the boy to take him again
to the place behind the big hill, and to come for him
the next morning; and when the boy went for him
again, he found with him a beautiful black gelding.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>97]</a></span>
And so for ten nights, he left the horse among the
hills, and each morning he found a different colored
horse, a bay, a roan, a gray, a blue, a spotted horse,
and all of them finer than any horses that the Pawnees
had ever had in their tribe before.</p>

<p>Now the boy was rich, and he married the beautiful
daughter of the Head Chief, and when he became
older, he was made Head Chief himself. He
had many children by his beautiful wife, and one day
when his oldest boy died, he wrapped him in the
spotted calf robe and buried him in it. He always
took good care of his old grandmother, and kept her
in his own lodge until she died. The dun horse was
never ridden except at feasts, and when they were
going to have a doctors&rsquo; dance, but he was always
led about with the Chief, wherever he went. The
horse lived in the village for many years, until he
became very old. And at last he died.</p>



<p class="padtop"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>98]</a></span></p>

<h3>A STORY OF FAITH.</h3>


<p><span class="dropcap">L</span>ONG ago, before they ever had any of these
doctors&rsquo; dances, there was, in the Kit-ke-hahk&acute;-i
tribe, a young boy, small, growing up. He
seemed not to go with the other boys nor to play
with them, but would keep away from them. He
would go off by himself, and lie down, and sometimes
they would find him crying, or half crying.
He seemed to have peculiar ways. His father and
mother did not try to interfere with him, but let him
alone. Sometimes they would find him with mud or
clay smeared over his face and head. That is the
sign of a doctor. When you see a person putting
mud on his face or head, it shows that he has faith
in the earth. From the earth are taken the roots
that they use in medicine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>99]</a></span>
When the parents saw this, they did not understand
it. How should he know anything about mud
being the sign of a doctor? They did not understand,
but they just let him do it.</p>

<p>The boy grew up till he came to have the ways of
a young man, but he never went with any of the
other boys. After he had grown up, they saw that
he had something in his mind. Sometimes he would
fast for two days, and sit by himself, smoking and
praying to <i>Ti-ra&acute;-wa</i>, and not saying anything to any
one. His father was a brave but not a chief, and
had plenty of horses. The son was well dressed and
comfortably off.</p>

<p>When any one in the camp was sick, this young
man would take pity on him, and of his own accord
would go and doctor him, and pretty soon the person
would be well again. Through his doing this, the
people began to hear about him, and his name became
great. He was humble, and did not want to
be thought well of. He was not proud, but he was
always doing good. At that time, there were many
doctors in the tribe, and they wondered how it was
that he could cure so many people, when he had
never been taught by any of them. They could not
understand it, and they began to be jealous of him.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>100]</a></span>
He never wanted to be with the doctors, but liked
to stay by himself. He wanted to be alone rather
than with any one.</p>

<p>In that time there were bad doctors, and they began
to hear about this humble man and to be jealous
of him. These bad doctors could curse a man, and
he would be cursed, and could poison one. They
had great power and influence, for everybody feared
them.</p>

<p>The bands of the Pawnees were not then together,
as they are now. As the people talked about this
young man, one of the other bands heard about him.
In this band was a great doctor, and this doctor
thought to himself, &ldquo;This young man&rsquo;s influence is
growing. If I do not do something, he will soon be
ahead of me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This great doctor went to the village to visit this
young man, to see how he looked, and to find out
how he got his knowledge and his power, for he
knew he had never been taught. He wanted to eat
with him, and talk with him, and find out whence his
learning came. He reached the Kit-ke-hahk&acute;-i village.
He was welcomed, and the young man treated
him with respect, and asked him to come into the
lodge, and sit down with him. At night they talked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>101]</a></span>
together. The great doctor said, &ldquo;I am glad to see
you. You can come to me for advice sometimes.&rdquo;
The young man thanked him. They smoked together.
It is the custom always when an Indian is
visiting another, for the one that is being visited to
present all the smokes; but at this time the great
doctor said, &ldquo;We will smoke my tobacco.&rdquo; So all
night they smoked his tobacco. The next morning
he went away. He did not again eat with the young
man. He said, &ldquo;I am glad, and I am going.&rdquo; And
he went away to his village. This happened in the
winter.</p>

<p>This young man was not married. His father had
asked him to marry, but he would not. He said he
had reasons.</p>

<p>About summer time, he felt different from what he
had. He was drowsy and felt badly. He felt heavy.
He seemed to be swelling up with some strange new
disease. The great doctor had poisoned him with
this result. How it was no one can tell, but it was
so. This was a disgrace, and he did not know how
to get out of it. There was no way. He would go
off and cry, and pray to <i>Ti-ra&acute;-wa</i>, and sometimes
would stay for three or four days without anything
to eat. He was so miserable that one time he was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>102]</a></span>
going to kill himself. He did not tell his father or
any one about this, but kept it to himself. The tribe
went off on a hunt and left the old village. Before
they started, the man went off on a hill somewhere
to meditate and pray, and his father told him that
when he was ready to start he should ride such a
horse, and he left it in the village for him when he
should come in.</p>

<p>When he came into the empty village he found the
horse tied there, and he saddled it and started; but
instead of going in the direction the tribe had taken,
he went east. His horse was a fine one. He went
away off by himself for some days, and at last he
stopped, and got off his horse, and tied it to a tree.
Then he called aloud and said, &ldquo;<i>A-ti-us ta&acute;-kaw-a</i>
(My Father, in all places), it is through you that I am
living. Perhaps it was through you that this man
put me in this condition. You are the ruler. Nothing
is impossible to you. If you see fit, take this away
from me.&rdquo; Then he turned round and said, &ldquo;Now,
you, all fish of the rivers, and you, all birds of the
air, and all animals that move upon the earth, and
you, oh Sun! I present to you this animal.&rdquo; He
said again, &ldquo;You birds in the air, and you animals
upon the earth, we are related, we are alike in this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>103]</a></span>
respect, that one ruler made us all. You see me, how
unhappy I am. If you have any power, intercede
for me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When he had finished his prayer, he went up to
the horse, and stabbed it with his knife and killed it,
and it fell down dead. He turned it so that its head
was toward the east, and raised it on its belly,
doubling its knees under it, and cut the hide down
the back, and skinned it down on both sides, so that
the birds of the air and the animals of the earth
might feed on it.</p>

<p>The tribe at this time was camped on the head of
the Republican River. He went on toward the east
until he came to the place on the Platte River called
<i>Pa-huk&acute;</i> (hill island). He saw that there were
many wild animals on this point, and he liked it, and
thought he would stay there, and perhaps dream.
He stopped there a while, feeling very badly, and
mourning all the time on this point. He was there
several days, and one night it happened that he went
to sleep [fainted], for he was exhausted with much
weeping and praying. Something spoke to him, and
said, &ldquo;What are you doing here?&rdquo; He woke up,
and looked around, but saw no one. It was only a
voice. Another night when he was asleep a voice
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>104]</a></span>
asked him, &ldquo;What are you doing here?&rdquo; He awoke
and looked about, but saw no one. A third night
the same thing happened, and he was wondering
what it meant. Then he answered and said, &ldquo;Who
ever you are who speaks to me, look at me and you
will see that I am poor in mind.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> I am a man, and
yet I am in a condition that no man was ever in
before. I am here only to suffer and to die. Whoever
you are who speaks to me, take pity on me and
help me.&rdquo; He received no answer.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_4_4" id="Footnote_4_4"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4_4"><span class="label">[4]</span></a>
Poor in mind, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>, despondent, miserable, unhappy.</p>
</div>

<p>The fourth night something touched him. He was
half awake when he felt it. Something said, &ldquo;What
are you doing here?&rdquo; He was lying on his side, his
head toward the east and his feet toward the west.
Something tapped him on the shoulder, and he
looked up and saw a great big animal, big black eyes
and a whitish body, <i>Pah&acute;</i>, big elk. When he looked
at it, the animal said, &ldquo;Get up and sit down;&rdquo; and
the elk too sat down. The elk said, &ldquo;I have heard of
you and of your condition, and I am here to tell you
that we all know your trouble. Right here where
you are, under you, is the home of the <i>Nahu&acute;rac</i>
(animals). I know that it is impossible to help you,
but I shall let them know&mdash;they already know&mdash;that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>105]</a></span>
you are here. I can only help you so far as to take
you to the places where these animals are. If this
animal home cannot help you, I will take you to
another place; if that fails, I will take you to another
place; if that fails, to another. Then you will see
that I have done my part. If it is impossible for the
animals to do it, we have still one above that we look
to.&rdquo; As soon as he had said this, he vanished like a
wind; disappeared all at once.</p>

<p>While the boy sat there, thinking about what the
animal had said to him, he fell asleep with his mind
full of these things. In his sleep something talked
to him. It said, &ldquo;I know that you feel badly, and
that your mind is poor. I have passed you many
times, and I have heard you crying. I belong here,
but I am one of the servants. I have informed my
leaders, those who command me, about you, and that
you are so poor in your mind, and they have said to
me, &lsquo;If you take pity on him, do as you please,
because you are our servant.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>At this time he woke up, and saw sitting by him a
little bird.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> He talked to it. He said, &ldquo;Oh, my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>106]</a></span>
brother, I feel pleased that you understand my poor
mind. Now take pity on me and help me.&rdquo; The
bird said to him, &ldquo;You must not talk in this way to
me. I am only a servant. To-morrow night I will
come this way, and will show you what to do. To-morrow
night I will come this way, and whatever you
see me do, you do the same thing.&rdquo; Then he disappeared.
The man then felt a little easier in his
mind, and more as if there were some hope for him.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_5_5" id="Footnote_5_5"></a><a href="#FNanchor_5_5"><span class="label">[5]</span></a>
This is a small bird, blue above, white below, with red legs.
It is swift-flying, and sometimes dives down into the water. It
is the messenger bird of the <i>Nahu&acute;rac</i>. See also story of the
<a href="#Page_161">Boy who was Sacrificed</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>The next night the bird came, and was flying
about near him after dark, waiting for the time.
When the time came, the bird flew close to him, and
said, &ldquo;Come. Let us go to the edge of the cut
bank.&rdquo; When they had come to the edge of the
bank above the water in the river, the bird said,
&ldquo;Now, my friend, you are poor. What I do, you do.
When I dive down off this bank, you follow me.&rdquo;
The man replied to him, &ldquo;Yes, I am poor. Whatever
you tell me to do, I will do.&rdquo; So when the bird
dived down off the cut bank, the man threw off
everything, and cared nothing for what he did
except to follow the bird. He leaped down after it,
and as he sprang, it seemed to him that he felt like a
bird, and could sail this way and that. He did not
feel as if he were falling, and were going to be hurt,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>107]</a></span>
but as if he were flying, and could control his movements.
Just as he reached the water in his fall, it
seemed to him that he was standing in the entrance
way of a lodge, and could look through into it and
see the fire burning in the middle.</p>

<p>While he was standing there, the bird flew in ahead
of him, and he heard it say, &ldquo;Here he is.&rdquo; He
stepped toward the entrance, and just as he came to
it the <i>Nahu&acute;rac</i> all made their different noises, for
they are not used to the smell of human beings.
The bears growled, and the panthers and wild cats
and wolves and rattlesnakes and other animals all
made their sounds. As he went in, there was a bear
standing on one side, and a great snake on the other,
and it was very difficult for the man to go in. He
hesitated a little to enter that narrow passage, but
something behind him seemed to push him ahead,
although the bear stood ready to seize him, and the
snake was rattling and standing up as if about to
strike. If he had not had the courage to pass them
he would have been lost, but he looked neither to
the right nor to the left, but walked straight ahead
past them. As soon as he had passed them, they
both sank back and were quiet. Then all the
<i>Nahu&acute;rac</i> made another kind of a noise, as if
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>108]</a></span>
welcoming him. The bear began to lie down; and the
snake stretched itself out again. As he went in he
just stood there and looked around. He saw there
all kinds of animals. The head doctor was a white
beaver, very large, there was another a garfish,
another an otter, and the fourth was a sandhill
crane.</p>

<p>The man sat down, and he looked very pitiful.
Then for a while everything was silent. Then the
servant said to the four head doctors, &ldquo;I have
brought this man here. I have taken pity on him,
and I want you to take pity on him.&rdquo; Then it was
more silent than ever. The man looked about him,
and saw all the animals, and saw them roll their eyes
around at him.</p>

<p>Presently the servant got up, and stood right in
the midst. The head doctors sat at the back of the
lodge opposite the door on the other side of the fire.
The bird said, &ldquo;My rulers, you know me. I am
your servant, and I am always obedient to your commands.
No matter what you tell me to do, I do it.
No matter how long the journeys you send me on, I
go. Many nights I have lost sleep because of carrying
out your commands. I have seen this man many
times, and I am weary of his crying as I fly back and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>109]</a></span>
forth. Now, I want you to take pity on this man,
because I pity him. Look on this poor-minded man
and pity him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then the bird went to the young man, and took
from him his pipe, which was filled, and carried it
round and stood before the beaver, the head doctor,
and held out the pipe to him to take. The white
beaver did not stretch out his hand for it, and the
bird stood there for a long time. At last the bird
began to cry, and the tears began to run down its
face, and it cried hard; and at last the white beaver
stretched out his hand, and then drew it back again,
and hesitated; and the bird kept on crying, and at
length the head doctor reached out his hand and
took the pipe. Just as soon as he took the pipe, all
the animals made a kind of a hissing sound, as much
as to say, <i>Loo&acute;ah</i>&mdash;Good. They were pleased. Then
the white beaver, holding the pipe, said, &ldquo;I cannot
help but reach out for this pipe, for I take pity on
my servant. But it is impossible for me to promise
that I will do this thing, but I will do what I can. I
will leave it to this other <i>Nahu&acute;rac</i> to say what shall
be done;&rdquo; and he passed the pipe to the other
<i>Nahu&acute;rac</i> who sat next to him. This animal reached
for the pipe, and took it. He made a speech, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>110]</a></span>
said, &ldquo;My friends, I am poor, I am poor. I have not
such power as that;&rdquo; and he passed the pipe to
another; and he said, &ldquo;I have not the power;&rdquo; and
he passed it to another; and so it went around the
circle. The pipe had passed around, and none of
the <i>Nahu&acute;rac</i> had the power. None of them seemed
to understand how to help the man. Then the white
beaver said, &ldquo;My friend, you see that no one of us
have the power to help you. There is another lodge
of <i>Nahu&acute;rac</i> at <i>Pa&acute;howa</i>. You must go there and
ask them.&rdquo; Then the <i>Nahu&acute;rac</i> made medicine, and
the young man went to sleep, and when he awoke at
daylight, he found himself on the point where he
had lain down to sleep the night before.</p>

<p>He was discouraged and wept all day long. At
night the elk came to him and said, &ldquo;Go to sleep; I
will take you over to <i>Pa&acute;howa</i>.&rdquo; The man slept and
the elk took him on its back and carried him while
asleep, and the next morning he found himself on
that point of <i>Pa&acute;howa</i>.</p>

<p>That night the messenger bird came to him and
said, &ldquo;Now, my friend, follow me, and what you see
me do, that do yourself. When I dive down into
<i>Pa&acute;howa</i>, you follow me.&rdquo; The bird dived down
into the spring, and the young man jumped after
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>111]</a></span>
him, and again found himself standing at the door
of a lodge, and the same things took place as before.
Here the same animals were the head doctors. The
chief head doctor talked to the boy and said, &ldquo;My
friend, I am sorry you have come to me in the condition
you are in. My friend, this is something impossible.
If it were anything else it might be possible
for us to cure your trouble. Nothing like it
was ever known before.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When he had said this he turned to the <i>Nahu&acute;rac</i>
and said, &ldquo;Now you shall be the leaders. If there
are any of you who understand things like this; if
any of you can take the lead in things like this, why
do it. It is beyond my power. Say what shall be
done, any of you. My mind would be big if any of
you could take pity on this poor man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Another one of the <i>Nahu&acute;rac</i> stood up and spoke,
&ldquo;My brother [to the white beaver], and my brother
[to the young man], do not feel hard at me. This is
beyond my power. I cannot do anything to help
him.&rdquo; So it went around the circle, every one
saying that it was impossible. After it had gone
round, the head doctor again stood up and said,
&ldquo;Now, my friend, you can see that it is impossible
to cure you of this trouble, but there is another
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>112]</a></span>
lodge of the <i>Nahu&acute;rac</i> on the west side of the Loup
River. You go there.&rdquo; Then they put him to sleep,
and when he awoke next morning, he was on top of
the ground near <i>Pa&acute;howa</i>.</p>

<p>That night the elk took him while he was asleep
to the place on the Loup. The next night he was
sitting on the ground there, and the bird came to
him, and he followed the bird down over the bank
and into the <i>Nahu&acute;rac</i> lodge. Here the head
doctors were the same animals, and they made
speeches as had been done at the other places, and,
as before, it was left to the assembly, and all agreed
that it was beyond their power. Then the white
beaver directed him to go to an island in the Platte,
near the Lone Tree, where there was another lodge
of the <i>Nahu&acute;rac</i>. The elk took him to this island.
Under the center of this island was the lodge. The
messenger bird was with him and went into the
lodge and asked the <i>Nahu&acute;rac</i> to help him. The
white beaver made a speech, and said, &ldquo;My friend,
I have heard the condition that you are in. Of all
these lodges that you have visited, that lodge at
<i>Pa-huk&acute;</i> is the head. I want you to go back there,
and tell the leaders there that they are the rulers,
and that whatever they shall do will be right, and will
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>113]</a></span>
be agreed to by the other lodges. They must help
you if they can. If they cannot do it, no one can.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When the elk took him back to <i>Pa-huk&acute;</i>, the bird
again conducted him into the lodge. He had left
his pipe here. When he entered the lodge all the
animals made a hissing sound&mdash;<i>No&acute;a</i>&mdash;they were
glad to see him again. The man stood in the middle
of the lodge and spoke. He said, &ldquo;Now you
animals all, you are the leaders. You see how poor
my mind is. I am tired of the long journeys you
have sent me on. I want you to take pity on me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The white beaver stood up and took the pipe and
said, &ldquo;Oh, my brother, I have done this to try these
other lodges of <i>Nahu&acute;rac</i>, to see if any of them were
equal to me. That was the reason that I sent you
around to all these other lodges, to see if any of
them would be willing to undertake to rid you of
your burden. But I see that they all still acknowledge
that I am the leader. Now I have here an
animal that I think will undertake to help you and
to rid you of your trouble.&rdquo; Saying this he stepped
out to the right, and walked past some of the <i>Nahu&acute;rac</i>
until he came to a certain animal&mdash;a ground dog&mdash;and
held out the pipe to it. There were twelve of
these animals, all alike&mdash;small, with round faces and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>114]</a></span>
black whiskers&mdash;sitting on their haunches. He held
out the pipe to the head one of these twelve. When
the white beaver reached out the pipe to this animal
he did not take it. He hesitated a long time, and
held his head down. He did not want to take the
pipe. He looked around the lodge, and at the man,
and drew in his breath. At last he reached out his
paws and took the pipe, and as he did so, all the
<i>Nahu&acute;rac</i> made a noise, the biggest kind of a noise.
They were glad.</p>

<p>Then the head ground dog got up and said, &ldquo;Now,
doctors, I have accepted this pipe on account of our
servant, who is so faithful, and who many a night has
lost sleep on account of our commands. I have accepted
it for his sake. It is impossible to do this
thing. If it had been earlier, I could perhaps have
done it. Even now I will try, and if I fail now, we
can do nothing for him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After they had smoked, they told the man to go
and sit down opposite the entrance to the lodge, between
the head doctors and the fire. These twelve
animals stood up and walked back and forth on the
opposite side of the fire from him, facing him. After
a while they told him to stand up. The head ground
dog now asked the other <i>Nahu&acute;rac</i> to help him, by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>115]</a></span>
singing, and they all sang; and the ground dogs
danced, keeping time to the singing, and moved
their hands up and down, and made their jaws go as
if eating, but did not open their mouths.</p>

<p>After a while they told him to lie down with his
head toward the doctors and his feet toward the
entrance. After he had lain down, they began to
move and went round the lodge toward him, and
the head ground dog jumped over the man&rsquo;s belly,
and as he jumped over him he was seen to have a
big piece of flesh in his mouth, and was eating it.
Another ground dog followed him, and another, and
each one ran until he came to the man, and as each
one jumped over him, it had a piece of flesh in its
mouth, eating it. So they kept going until they had
eaten all the swelling. The young man was unconscious
all this time, for he afterward said he knew
nothing of what had happened.</p>

<p>The head ground dog spoke to the animals, and
said, &ldquo;Now, <i>Nahu&acute;rac</i>, you have seen what I can do.
This is the power that I have. That is the reason
I am afraid to be out on the prairie, because when I
get hungry I would kill men and would eat them.
My appetite would overpower me, and I do not want
to do these things, I want to be friendly. This is the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>116]</a></span>
reason that I do not travel around on top of the
ground. I stay hid all the time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The man was still unconscious, and the head
ground dog said, &ldquo;Now, <i>Nahu&acute;rac</i>, I do not understand
how to restore this man. I leave that to you.&rdquo;
Then the ground dogs went back to their places and
sat down. Then the head doctor, the beaver, spoke
to the bears. He said, &ldquo;Now this man belongs to
you. Let me see what you can do.&rdquo; The head
bear got up and said, &ldquo;Very well, I will come. I
will let you see what I can do.&rdquo; Then the bears
stood up and began to sing. The head bear would
jump on top of the man, and act as if he were going
to tear him to pieces, and the others would take hold
of him, and shake him around, and at last his blood
began to flow and the man began to breathe, but he
was still unconscious. After a while he moved and
came to life, and felt himself just as he had been
many months before. He found that his trouble
was gone and that he was cured.</p>

<p>The head bear still stood by him and spoke to
the <i>Nahu&acute;rac</i>. He said, &ldquo;Now, <i>Nahu&acute;rac</i>, this is
what I can do. I do not care how dangerously
wounded I may be, I know how to cure myself. If
they leave any breath at all in me, I know how to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>117]</a></span>
cure myself.&rdquo; Then the bears went to their place
and sat down.</p>

<p>The man got up and spoke to the <i>Nahu&acute;rac</i>, thanking
them for what they had done for him. He stayed
there several nights, watching the doings of the
<i>Nahu&acute;rac</i>. They taught him all their ways, all the
animal secrets. The head doctor said to him, &ldquo;Now,
I am going to send you back to your home, but I
will ask a favor of you, in return for what I have
done for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The man answered him, &ldquo;It will be so, whatever
you say.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The doctor said, &ldquo;Through you let my animals
that move in the river be fed. Now you can see
who we are. I move in the water. I have no breath,
but I exist. We every one of us shall die except
<i>Ti-ra&acute;-wa</i>. He made us, just as he made you. He
made you to live in the air. We live where there is
no air. You see the difference. I know where is
that great water that surrounds us [the ocean]. I
know that the heaven [sky] is the house of <i>Ti-ra&acute;-wa</i>,
and we live inside of it. You must imitate us.
Do as we do. You must place your dependence on
us, but still, if anything comes up that is very difficult,
you must put your dependence on <i>Ti-ra&acute;-wa</i>.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>118]</a></span>
Ask help from the ruler. He made us. He made
every thing. There are different ways to different
creatures. What you do I do not do, and what I do
you do not do. We are different. When you
imitate us you must always blow a smoke to each one
of these four chief doctors, once to each; but to
<i>Ti-ra&acute;-wa</i> you must blow four smokes. And always
blow four to the night, to the east, because something
may tell you in your sleep a thing which will
happen. This smoke represents the air filled with
the smoke of hazy days. That smoke is pleasant to
<i>Ti-ra&acute;-wa</i>. He made it himself. Now go home, and
after you have been there for a time, go and pay a
visit to the doctor who put you in this condition.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The young man went home to his village, and got
there in the night. He had long been mourned as
dead, and his father was now poor in mind on
account of him. He went into his father&rsquo;s lodge,
and touched him, and said, &ldquo;Wake up, I am here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His father could not believe it. He had thought
him dead a long time. He said, &ldquo;Is it you, or is it
a ghost?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The young man answered, &ldquo;It is I, just the same
as ever. Get up, and go and tell my uncles and all
my relations that I am here. I want you to give me
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>119]</a></span>
something; a blue bead, and some Indian tobacco,
and some buffalo meat, and a pipe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The father went about and told his relations that
his son had come back, and they were very glad, and
came into the lodge, bringing the presents, and gave
them to the boy. He took them, and went down to
the river, and threw them in, and they were carried
down to the <i>Nahu&acute;rac</i> lodge at <i>Pa-huk&acute;</i>.</p>

<p>A few days after this the boy got on his horse, and
rode away to visit the doctor who had brought his
trouble on him. When he reached the village, the
people said to the doctor, &ldquo;A man is coming to visit
you,&rdquo; and the doctor was troubled, for he knew what
he had done to the boy. But he thought that he
knew so much that no one could get the better of
him. When the boy came to the lodge, he got off
his horse, went in and was welcomed. After they
had eaten, the boy said to him, &ldquo;When you visited
me we smoked your tobacco; to-day we will smoke
mine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They did so, for the doctor thought that no one
could overcome him. They smoked until daylight,
and while they were smoking, the boy kept moving
his jaws as if eating, but did not open his mouth.
At daylight the boy said he must be going. He
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>120]</a></span>
went, and when he got down to the river, he blew
strongly upon the ice, and immediately the water in
the river was full of blood. It was the blood of the
doctor. It seems that the ground dogs had taught
the young man how to do their things.</p>

<p>When the people found the doctor he was dead
in his lodge, and he was all hollow. All his blood
and the inside of him had gone into the river, and
had gone down to feed the animals. So the boy
kept his promise to the <i>Nahu&acute;rac</i> and had revenge
on the doctor.</p>

<p>The boy was the greatest doctor in the Kit-ke-hahk&acute;-i
band, and was the first who taught them all
the doctors&rsquo; ceremonies that they have. He taught
them all the wonderful things that the doctors can
do, and many other things.</p>

<h3>THE BEAR MAN.</h3>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HERE was once a young boy, who, when he
was playing with his fellows, used often to
imitate the ways of a bear, and to pretend that he
was one. The boys did not know much about bears.
They only knew that there were such animals.</p>

<p>Now, it had happened that before this boy was
born his mother had been left alone at home, for his
father had gone on the warpath toward the enemy,
and this was about five or six months before the babe
would be born. As the man was going on the warpath,
he came upon a little bear cub, very small,
whose mother had gone away; and he caught it. He
did not want to kill it because it was so young and
helpless. It seemed to him like a little child. It
looked up to him, and cried after him, because it
knew no better; and he hated to kill it or to leave it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>122]</a></span>
there. After he had thought about this for a while,
he put a string around its neck and tied some
medicine smoking stuff, Indian tobacco, to it, and
said, &ldquo;<i>Pi-rau&acute;</i>&mdash;child, you are a <i>Nahu&acute;rac</i>; <i>Ti-ra&acute;-wa</i>
made you, and takes care of you. He will look
after you, but I put these things about your neck to
show that I have good feelings toward you. I hope
that when my child is born, the <i>Nahu&acute;rac</i> will take
care of him, and see that he grows up a good man,
and I hope that <i>Ti-ra&acute;-wa</i> will take care of you and
of mine.&rdquo; He looked at the little bear for quite a
long time, and talked to it, and then he went on his
way.</p>

<p>When he returned to the village from his warpath,
he told his wife about the little bear, and how he had
looked at it and talked to it.</p>

<p>When his child was born it had all the ways of a
bear. So it is among the Pawnees. A woman,
before her child is born, must not look hard at any
animal, for the child may be like it. There was a
woman in the Kit-ke-hahk&acute;-i band, who caught a
rabbit, and, because it was gentle and soft, she took
it up in her hands and held it before her face and
petted it, and when her child was born it had a split
nose, like a rabbit. This man is still alive.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>123]</a></span>
This boy, who was like a bear, as he grew up, had
still more the ways of a bear. Often he would go
off by himself, and try to pray to the bear, because
he felt like a bear. He used to say, in a joking way,
to the other young men, that he could make himself
a bear.</p>

<p>After he had come to be a man, he started out
once on the warpath with a party of about thirty-five
others. He was the leader of the party. They went
away up on the Running Water, and before they had
come to any village, they were discovered by Sioux.
The enemy pursued them, and surrounded them, and
fought with them. The Pawnees were overpowered,
their enemies were so many, and all were killed.</p>

<p>The country where this took place is rocky, and
much cedar grows there. Many bears lived there.
The battle was fought in the morning; and the Pawnees
were all killed in a hollow. Right after the
fight, in the afternoon, two bears came traveling
along by this place. When they came to the spot
where the Pawnees had been killed, they found one
of the bodies, and the she bear recognized it as that
of the boy who was like a bear. She called to the he
bear, and said, &ldquo;Here is the man that was very good
to us. He often sacrificed smokes to us, and every
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>124]</a></span>
time he ate he used always to take a piece of food
and give it to us, saying, &lsquo;Here is something for you
to eat. Eat this.&rsquo; Here is the one that always
imitated us, and sung about us, and talked about us.
Can you do anything for him?&rdquo; The he bear said,
&ldquo;I fear I cannot do it. I have not the power, but I
will try. I can do anything if the sun is shining. I
seem to have more power when the sun is shining on
me.&rdquo; That day it was cloudy and cold and snowing.
Every now and then the clouds would pass, and the
sun come out for a little while, and then the clouds
would cover it up again.</p>

<p>The man was all cut up, pretty nearly hacked in
small pieces, for he was the bravest of all. The two
bears gathered up the pieces of the man, and put
them together, and then the he bear lay down and
took the man on his breast, and the she bear lay on
top of it to warm the body. They worked over it
with their medicine, and every now and then the he
bear would cry out, and say, &ldquo;<i>A-ti&acute;-us</i>&mdash;Father, help
me. I wish the sun was shining.&rdquo; After a while the
dead body grew warm, and then began to breathe a
little. It was still all cut up, but it began to have life.
Pretty soon the man began to move, and to come to
life, and then he became conscious and had life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>125]</a></span>
When he came to himself and opened his eyes he
was in the presence of two bears. The he bear
spoke to him, and said, &ldquo;It is not through me that
you are living. It was the she bear who asked for
help for you, and had you brought back to life.
Now, you are not yet whole and well. You must
come away with us, and live with us for a time,
until all your wounds are healed.&rdquo; The bears took
him away with them. But the man was very weak,
and every now and then, as they were going along,
he would faint and fall down; but still they would
help him up and support him; and they took him
along with them, until they came to a cave in the
rocks among the cedars, which was their home.
When he entered the cave, he found there their young
ones that they had left behind when they started out.</p>

<p>The man was all cut up and gashed. He had also
been scalped, and had no hair on his head. He
lived with the bears until he was quite healed of his
wounds, and also had come to understand all their
ways. The two old bears taught him everything
that they knew. The he bear said to him, &ldquo;None
of all the beings and animals that roam over the
country are as great and as wise as the bears. No
animal is equal to us. When we get hungry, we go
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>126]</a></span>
out and kill something and eat it. I did not make
the wisdom that I have. I am an animal, and I look
to one above. He made me, and he made me to be
great. I am made to live here and to be great, but
still there will be an end to my days, just as with all
of us that <i>Ti-ra&acute;-wa</i> has created upon this earth. I
am going to make you a great man; but you must
not deceive yourself. You must not think that I am
great, or can do great things of myself. You must
always look up above for the giver of all power. You
shall be great in war and great in wealth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now you are well, and I shall take you back to
your home, and after this I want you to imitate us.
This shall be a part of your greatness. I shall look
after you. I shall give to you a part of myself. If I
am killed, you shall be killed. If I grow old, you
shall be old.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want you to look at one of the trees that
<i>Ti-ra&acute;-wa</i> made in this earth, and place your dependence
on it. <i>Ti-ra&acute;-wa</i> made this tree (pointing
to a cedar). It never gets old. It is always green
and young. Take notice of this tree, and always have
it with you; and when you are in the lodge and it
thunders and lightens,<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> throw some of it on the fire
and let the smoke rise. Hold that fast.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_6_6" id="Footnote_6_6"></a><a href="#FNanchor_6_6"><span class="label">[6]</span></a>
A cedar is never struck by lightning.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>127]</a></span>
The he bear took the skin of a bear, and made a
cap for him, to hide his naked skull. His wounds
were now all healed, and he was well and strong.
The man&rsquo;s people had nearly forgotten him, it had
been so long ago, and they had supposed that the
whole party had been killed.</p>

<p>Soon after this the he bear said, &ldquo;Now we will
take that journey.&rdquo; They started, and went to the
village, and waited near it till it was night. Then
the bear said to him, &ldquo;Go into the village, and tell
your father that you are here. Then get for me a
piece of buffalo meat, and a blue bead, and some
Indian tobacco, and some sweet smelling clay.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_7_7" id="Footnote_7_7"></a><a href="#FNanchor_7_7"><span class="label">[7]</span></a>
A green clay, which they roast, and which then turns dark
red, and has a sweet smell.</p>
</div>

<p>The man went into the village, and his father was
very much surprised, and very glad to see him again.
He got the presents, and brought them to the bear,
and gave them to him, and the bear talked to him.</p>

<p>When they were about to part, the bear came up to
him, and put his arms about him, and hugged him,
and put his mouth against the man&rsquo;s mouth, and
said, &ldquo;As the fur that I am in has touched you it
will make you great, and this will be a blessing to
you.&rdquo; His paws were around the man&rsquo;s shoulders,
and he drew them down his arms, until they came to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>128]</a></span>
his hands, and he held them, and said, &ldquo;As my hands
have touched your hands, they are made great, not
to fear anything. I have rubbed my hands down
over you, so that you shall be as tough as I am.
Because my mouth has touched your mouth you
shall be made wise.&rdquo; Then he left him, and went
away.</p>

<p>So this man was the greatest of all warriors, and
was brave. He was like a bear. He originated the
bear dance which still exists among the tribe of Pawnees.
He came to be an old man, and at last died
of old age. I suspect the old bear died at the same
time.</p>

<h3>THE GHOST WIFE.</h3>


<p><span class="dropcap">O</span>NE time there were living together a man and
his wife. They had a young child. The
woman died. The man was very sad, and mourned
for his wife.</p>

<p>One night he took the child in his arms, and went
out from the village to the place where his wife was
buried, and stood over the grave, and mourned for his
wife. The little child was very helpless, and cried
all the time. The man&rsquo;s heart was sick with grief
and loneliness. Late in the night he fell asleep,
fainting and worn out with sorrow. After a while he
awoke, and when he looked up, there was a form
standing by him. The form standing there was the
one who had died. She spoke to her husband, and
said, &ldquo;You are very unhappy here. There is a place
to go where we would not be unhappy. Where I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>130]</a></span>
have been nothing bad happens to one. Here, you
never know what evil will come to you. You and the
child had better come to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The man did not want to die. He said to her,
&ldquo;No; it will be better if you can come back to us.
We love you. If you were with us we would be unhappy
no longer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For a long time they discussed this, to decide
which one should go to the other. At length the
man by his persuasions overcame her, and the woman
agreed to come back. She said to the man, &ldquo;If I am
to come back you must do exactly as I tell you for
four nights. For four days the curtain must remain
let down before my sleeping place; it must not be
raised; no one must look behind it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The man did as he had been told, and after four
days had passed, the curtain was lifted, and the
woman came out from behind it. Then they all saw
her, first her relations, and afterward the whole tribe.
Her husband and her child were very glad, and they
lived happily together.</p>

<p>A long time after this, the man took another wife.
The first wife was always pleasant and good-natured,
but the new one was bad-tempered, and after some
time she grew jealous of the first woman, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>131]</a></span>
quarreled with her. At length, one day the last married
became angry with the other, and called her bad
names, and finally said to her, &ldquo;You ought not to be
here. You are nothing but a ghost, anyway.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That night when the man went to bed, he lay
down, as was his custom, by the side of his first wife.
During the night he awoke, and found that his wife
had disappeared. She was seen no more. The next
night after this happened, the man and the child
both died in sleep. The wife had called them to
her. They had gone to that place where there is a
living.</p>

<p>This convinced everybody that there is a hereafter.</p>



<p class="padtop"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>132]</a></span></p>

<h3>TI-KE-WA-KUSH.</h3>

<p class="center smcap">The Man who Called the Buffalo.</p>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HIS happened in the olden time before we had
met the white people. Then the different
bands lived in separate villages. The lodges were
made of dirt. The Kit-ke-hahk&acute;-i band went off on
a winter hunt, roaming over the country, as they
used to do, after buffalo. At this time they did not
find the buffalo near. They scouted in all directions,
but could discover no signs of them. It was a hard
time of starvation. The children cried and the
women cried; they had nothing at all to eat.</p>

<p>There was a person who looked at the children
crying for something to eat, and it touched his heart.
They were very poor, and he felt sorry for them.
He said to the Head Chief, &ldquo;Tell the chiefs and
other head men to do what I tell them. My heart is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>133]</a></span>
sick on account of the suffering of the people. It
may be that I can help them. Let a new lodge be
set up outside the village for us to meet in. I will
see if I can do anything to relieve the tribe.&rdquo; The
Chief said that it was well to do this, and he gave
orders for it.</p>

<p>While they were preparing to build this lodge
they would miss this man in the night. He would
disappear like a wind, and go off a long way, and
just as daylight came, he would be there again.
Sometimes, while sitting in his own lodge during the
day, he would reach behind him, and bring out a
small piece of buffalo meat, fat and lean, and would
give it to some one, saying, &ldquo;When you have had
enough, save what is left, and give it to some one
else.&rdquo; When he would give this small piece of meat
to any one, the person would think, &ldquo;This is not
enough to satisfy my hunger;&rdquo; but after eating until
he was full, there was always enough left to give to
some other person.</p>

<p>In those days it was the custom for the Head
Chief of the tribe, once in a while, to mount his
horse, and ride about through the village, talking to
the people, and giving them good advice, and telling
them that they ought to do what was right by each
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>134]</a></span>
other. At this time the Chief spoke to the people,
and explained that this man was going to try to
benefit the tribe. So the people made him many
fine presents, otter skins and eagle feathers, and
when they gave him these things each one said, &ldquo;I
give you this. It is for yourself. Try to help us.&rdquo;
He thanked them for these presents, and when they
were all gathered together he said, &ldquo;Now you chiefs
and head men of the tribe, and you people, you have
done well to give me these things. I shall give them
to that person who gives me that power, and who
has taken pity on me. I shall let you starve yet four
days. Then help will come.&rdquo;</p>

<p>During these four days, every day and night he
disappeared, but would come back the same night.
He would say to the people that he had been far off,
where it would take a person three or four days to
go, but he was always back the same night. When
he got back on the fourth night, he told the people
that the buffalo were near, that the next morning
they would be but a little way off. He went up on
the hill near the camp, and sacrificed some eagle
feathers, and some blue beads, and some Indian
tobacco, and then returned to the camp. Then he
said to the people, &ldquo;When that object comes to that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>135]</a></span>
place of sacrifice, do not interfere with it; do not
turn it back. Let it go by. Just watch and see.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The next morning at daylight, all the people came
out of their lodges to watch this hill, and the place
where he had sacrificed. While they were looking
they saw a great buffalo bull come up over the hill to
the place. He stood there for a short time and
looked about, and then he walked on down the hill,
and went galloping off past the village. Then this
man spoke to the people, and said, &ldquo;There. That is
what I meant. That is the leader of the buffalo;
where he went the whole herd will follow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He sent his servant to the chiefs to tell them to
choose four boys, and let them go to the top of the
hill where the bull had come over, and to look beyond
it. The boys were sent, and ran to the top of
the hill, and when they looked over beyond it they
stopped, and then turned, and came back, running.
They went to the chiefs&rsquo; lodge, and said to the chiefs
sitting there, &ldquo;Beyond that place of sacrifice there is
coming a whole herd of buffalo; many, many, crowding
and pushing each other.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then, as it used to be in the old times, as soon as
the young men had told the Chief that the buffalo
were coming, the Chief rode about the village, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>136]</a></span>
told every one to get ready to chase them. He said
to them besides, &ldquo;Do not leave anything on the
killing ground. Bring into the camp not only the
meat and hides, but the heads and legs and all parts.
Bring the best portions in first, and take them over
to the new lodge, so that we may have a feast there.&rdquo;
For so the man had directed.</p>

<p>Presently the buffalo came over the hill, and the
people were ready, and they made a surround, and
killed all that they could, and brought them home.
Each man brought in his ribs and his young buffalo,
and left them there at that lodge. The other parts
they brought into the village, as he had directed.
After they had brought in this meat, they went to
the lodge, and staid there four days and four nights,
and had a great feast, roasting these ribs. The man
told them that they would make four surrounds like
this, and to get all the meat that they could, &ldquo;But,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;in surrounding these buffalo you must see
that all the meat is saved. <i>Ti-ra&acute;-wa</i> does not like
the people to waste the buffalo, and for that reason
I advise you to make good use of all you kill.&rdquo;
During the four nights they feasted this man used
to disappear each night.</p>

<p>On the night of the fourth day he said to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>137]</a></span>
people, &ldquo;To-morrow the buffalo will come again, and
you will make another surround. Be careful not to
kill a yellow calf&mdash;a little one&mdash;that you will see with
the herd, nor its mother.&rdquo; This was in winter, and
yet the calf was the same color as a young calf born
in the spring. They made the surround, and let the
yellow calf and its mother go.</p>

<p>A good many men in the tribe saw that this man
was great, and that he had done great things for the
tribe, and they made him many presents, the best
horses that they had. He thanked them, but he did
not want to accept the presents. The tribe believed
that he had done this wonderful thing&mdash;had brought
them buffalo&mdash;and all the people wanted to do just
what he told them to.</p>

<p>In the first two surrounds they killed many buffalo,
and made much dried meat. All their sacks were
full, and the dried meat was piled up out of doors.
After the second surround, they feasted as before.</p>

<p>After four days, as they were going out to surround
the buffalo the third time, the wind changed,
and before the people got near them, the buffalo
smelt them, and stampeded. While they were galloping
away, the man ran up on to the top of the
hill, to the place of sacrifice, carrying a pole, on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>138]</a></span>
which was tied the skin of a kit fox; and when he
saw the buffalo running, and that the people could
not catch them, he waved his pole, and called out
<i>Ska-a-a-a!</i> and the buffalo turned right about, and
charged back right through the people, and they
killed many of them. He wished to show the people
that he had the power over the buffalo.</p>

<p>After the third surround they had a great deal of
meat, and he called the chiefs together and said,
&ldquo;Now, my chiefs, are you satisfied?&rdquo; They said,
&ldquo;Yes, we are satisfied, and we are thankful to you
for taking pity on us and helping us. It is through
your power that the tribe has been saved from
starving to death.&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;You are to make one
more surround, and that will be the end. I want
you to get all you can. Kill as many as possible, for
this will be the last of the buffalo this winter. Those
presents that you have made to me, and that I did
not wish to take, I give them back to you.&rdquo; Some
of the people would not take back the presents, but
insisted that he should keep them, and at last he
said he would do so.</p>

<p>The fourth surround was made, and the people
killed many buffalo, and saved the meat. The night
after this last surround, he disappeared and drove
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>139]</a></span>
the buffalo back. The next morning he told the
people to look about, and tell him if they saw anything.
They did so, but they could not see any
buffalo.</p>

<p>The next day they moved camp, and went east
toward their home. They had so much dried meat
that they could not take it all at once, but had to
come back and make two trips for it. When they
moved below, going east, they had no fresh meat,
only dried meat; but sometimes when this man would
come in from his journeys, he would bring a piece of
meat&mdash;a little piece&mdash;and he would divide it up
among the people, and they would put it into the
kettles and boil it, and everybody would eat, but
they could not eat it all up. There would always be
some left over. This man was so wonderful that he
could change even the buffalo chips that you see
on the prairie into meat. He would cover them up
with his robe, and when he would take it off
again, you would see there pounded buffalo meat
and tallow (pemmican), <i>tup-o-har&acute;-ash</i>.</p>

<p>The man was not married; he was a young man,
and by this time the people thought that he was one
of the greatest men in the tribe, and they wanted
him to marry. They went to one of the chiefs and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>140]</a></span>
told him that they wanted him to be this man&rsquo;s
father-in-law, for they wanted him to raise children,
thinking that they might do something to benefit
the tribe. They did not want that race to die out.
The old people say that it would have been good if
he had had children, but he had none. If he had,
perhaps they would have had the same power as
their father.</p>

<p>That person called the buffalo twice, and twice
saved the tribe from a famine. The second time
the suffering was great, and they held a council to
ask him to help the tribe. They filled up the pipe
and held it out to him, asking him to take pity on
the tribe. He took the pipe, and lighted it, and
smoked. He did it in the same way as the first
time, and they made four surrounds, and got much
meat.</p>

<p>When this man died, all the people mourned for
him a long time. The Chief would ride around the
village and call out, &ldquo;Now I am poor in mind on
account of the death of this man, because he took
pity on us and saved the tribe. Now he is gone and
there is no one left like him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This is a true and sacred story that belongs to the
Kit-ke-hahk&acute;-i band. It happened once long ago,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>141]</a></span>
and has been handed down from father to son in
this band. The Skidi had a man who once called
the buffalo, causing them to return when stampeded,
as was done in this story.</p>


<p class="break"><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;Big Knife, a Skidi, who died only recently,
said that the man was alive in his time. <i>Kuru&acute;ks-u
le-shar</i> (Bear Chief), a Skidi, says that he knew the
man. His name was Carrying Mother.</p>

<h3>PA-HU-KA&acute;-TAWA.</h3>


<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>BOUT the end of the winter, before the grass
began to grow in the spring, a company of
three brothers and two other men went out from the
village to trap beaver. When they had been gone
about ten days, and had got up above the Forks of
the Loup River, they camped on the South Fork,
and in the morning sent one man ahead to see if he
could find any beaver sign, and could look out a
good trapping ground.</p>

<p>When he had gone a little distance from the camp,
he saw some Sioux, and at the same moment they
saw him. He did not run back to the camp; he was
too anxious to save himself; but ran across to a little
creek, and hid in the brush, not trying to let his
brothers know that the enemy were near. The Sioux
followed him and found him, and chased him about,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>143]</a></span>
and shot at him all day, until near sundown, when
they killed him.</p>

<p>The four other men had stopped in camp, but were
not so far off but that they could hear the shouts and
yells, and they ran off from the camp, and hid themselves
and waited. When the other man did not
come back, they knew that he had been killed.</p>

<p>The next morning, the four men talked together.
One said, &ldquo;We had better go up and see if he is
killed.&rdquo; Another said, &ldquo;Yes, let us go there. It
may be that we can bury him.&rdquo; So they went up
where he had been, going very carefully, and looking
over all the hills as they went, so as to see any enemies
if they were about. They found him. He was
dead, shot full of arrows, scalped, his whole head
skinned, his arms and legs unjointed, his head cut
off; he was all cut to pieces. So they thought that
there was not enough of him left to bury, and besides,
those killed in battle are often left unburied.
When they found how it was, they started back to
the village, and when they came close to it, one of
the men called out, &ldquo;<i>Pa-hu-ka&acute;-tawa</i> is killed!&rdquo; He
called that out so that the people might know, and
might begin to mourn.</p>

<p>When they came into the village, the relations of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>144]</a></span>
this man felt very badly because he was killed. It
was coming on toward the time when they begin to
clear up their patches, to plant the corn, and to hoe,
and his father and mother mourned, and said, &ldquo;Now
we have no one to help us hoe. We are old, and he
helped us; but now he is gone.&rdquo; So they mourned
for him.</p>

<p>They did not visit the place where he had been
killed for some time. It was now spring, and they
were planting, and hoeing the corn, and when they
got through their work, the whole tribe started out
on the summer hunt to get buffalo, as they used to
do. They started up the Loup, and when they had
traveled along a number of days, they came near the
place where the man had been killed. When they got
there, the men who had been with him said, &ldquo;This is
the place where <i>Pa-hu-ka&acute;-tawa</i> was killed,&rdquo; and his
father and mother and all his relations went over to
the place where he had lain, to gather his bones together
and then to bury them. When they got to
the place, they could find no bones at all, but the arrows
were there, sticking straight up in the ground;
all the arrows that had been shot into the body.
They wondered that they had not fallen down, for
they thought that the wolves might have dragged
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>145]</a></span>
the body, but when they looked everywhere about
for the bones, they could find no sign of them anywhere.
It seemed strange to them that the arrows
should be there standing up in the ground, and they
wondered what had become of the bones. At length
they gave up looking for them, and went back to the
camp. When they could not find the bones, they went
on and hunted buffalo, and killed plenty, and made
dried meat. After two months they started back to
the village, going down the Platte River. His mother
had cried so much for <i>Pa-hu-ka&acute;-tawa</i>, that she had
become blind.</p>

<p>One pleasant afternoon they were camped on the
Platte. The evening was warm and soft and still. As
the sun went down toward the earth, long shining
rays seemed to come down from it to the ground.
All through the air was a light smoke, and in the
west the sky was red. Just as the sun was setting,
the people all heard a voice calling from the other
side of the river. They listened; and the voice said,
&ldquo;<i>Pa-hu-ka&acute;-tawa</i> is coming back to you.&rdquo; Then all
the Indians jumped up, and ran across the river to
meet him, for they thought perhaps he was coming
back. When they had got to the other side, they
looked about, but could see no one. Then they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>146]</a></span>
heard a voice from behind them, on the other side
of the camp, which said, &ldquo;He is coming from here.&rdquo;
They all turned round and ran back to the other
side of the camp; but no one was there; and in a
little while they heard the voice again, on the other
side of the river, saying, &ldquo;He is coming.&rdquo; Then
they knew it was only a voice and not a person.
They stopped running about, and that night they
talked about the voice. The next day they went on
down the river, and at length got back to the main
village. There they stayed six months, and by this
time their dried meat was all eaten, and it was
toward spring.</p>

<p>The mother of <i>Pa-hu-ka&acute;-tawa</i> had her bed near
the door of the lodge on the left hand side, the last
bed next to the door. One night, at midnight, he
came into the lodge, and touched his mother and
said, &ldquo;Mother! mother!&rdquo; His mother used to dream
of him almost every night, and she thought she was
dreaming now. She said, &ldquo;Oh, my son, do not do
this. You are deceiving me again.&rdquo; He stopped;
but presently he touched her again, and pushed her
shoulder, and she awoke.</p>

<p>He said to her, &ldquo;Mother, I am here,&rdquo; and she
reached out and felt him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>147]</a></span>
She said, &ldquo;Are you really my son?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He answered, &ldquo;Yes, I am your son.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then she put her arms around him, and hugged
him, and said to him, &ldquo;Oh, my son, my son, you
have come back to me.&rdquo; She cried, she was so glad.</p>

<p>Then they talked together. He gave her a piece
of meat&mdash;a piece of fresh buffalo meat&mdash;though they
had had no fresh meat in the village for six months.
He said to his mother, &ldquo;I am really alive, though I
was killed. The <i>Nahu&acute;rac</i> (animals) took pity on
me, and have made me alive again. And now I am
going off; but do not cry about me any more.&rdquo;
Then he went away.</p>

<p>The next morning, when his mother awoke, she
found by her side the piece of fresh meat, and she
began to cook it on the coals. The people wondered
where she got the fresh meat, and asked her about
it, but she would not tell them where she got it, for
her son had told her to say nothing. They asked
her again where she got it, and she told them she
found it in her bed.</p>

<p>After a long time her son came again in the night,
and went into the lodge, and spoke to his mother,
saying, &ldquo;Mother, I am here again.&rdquo; She awoke,
and rejoiced that he had come back. He said to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>148]</a></span>
her, &ldquo;My mother, I know that you are poor. You
are blind on account of me, because you have cried
so much. Now, my mother, there is standing by the
side of your daughter&rsquo;s bed, water in a wooden bowl.
After I have left you to-night, go over there, and
put your face down deep into the water, and open
your eyes in the water, and then you will see.&rdquo; Before
he left her he gave her some <i>ka&acute;wis</i>.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_8_8" id="Footnote_8_8"></a><a href="#FNanchor_8_8"><span class="label">[8]</span></a>
Chopped buffalo meat tied up in the small intestine.</p>
</div>

<p>After he had gone, she did as he had told her.
She got up, and feeling her way along with her
hands, crept into the place where her daughter slept.
There she felt the wooden bowl with water in it, and
she put her face deep down into the water, and
opened her eyes in it, and when she took her face
out of the water, and opened her eyes again, she
could see. Then she was glad. Everybody wondered
how the mother&rsquo;s eyes had been cured, but
she told no one, except only her oldest son.</p>

<p>After a long time <i>Pa-hu-ka&acute;-tawa</i> came down
again to see his mother. He said to her, &ldquo;Mother,
I am going up to see my oldest brother.&rdquo; He went
to see his brother in the night. His brother was
expecting him, for his mother had warned him.
<i>Pa-hu-ka&acute;-tawa</i> said, &ldquo;Now, my brother, I think you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>149]</a></span>
have heard that I come all the time to see our
mother. I wish that you would put up your lodge
outside the camp, so that I can come and see you
often. I want to talk to you, and tell you my
thoughts and all my troubles. I am a spirit.&rdquo; His
brother answered him that he would do as he had
asked, and the first night after the lodge had been
set up outside the camp, <i>Pa-hu-ka&acute;-tawa</i> came down,
and said to his brother, &ldquo;To-morrow night I want
you to select the two bravest men in the tribe, and
let them go about through the camp, and call all the
chiefs and all the bravest warriors in the tribe, and
let them gather at your home. Do not build any fire
in the lodge. Let it all be dark, for I am coming
down in the night to see them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When the next night came, the chiefs and the
braves gathered at the lodge just about dark. They
made no fire, but sat there waiting for <i>Pa-hu-ka&acute;-tawa</i>
to come down. After a while he came down to the
lodge, and came in where they were sitting. When
they were all silent, he came in, and every step he
made it seemed that sparks of fire were flying out
from him. He went and stood before his brother,
and said to him, &ldquo;I am in everything; in the grass,
the water, the trees. I am a part of all these things.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>150]</a></span>
I know every thought of yours, and if you only
whispered, I would hear it. I know everything, and
about everything, even about the ocean which is so
far off, and where the water is salt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There are two dances that I like, in which there
are songs sung about me.&rdquo; Then he sang these
songs and told them how to dance these dances.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
He said, &ldquo;Dance these dances and sing about me,
calling me by name.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_9_9" id="Footnote_9_9"></a><a href="#FNanchor_9_9"><span class="label">[9]</span></a>
These dances afterward were practiced in two of the secret
societies.</p>
</div>

<p>Then he said, &ldquo;Brother, I want you to know that
there is a tribe of your enemies getting ready to go
on the warpath against you. I will let you know
when they start, and all they do. Every move they
make I will tell you of. They are coming from far
up the Missouri River.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Two or three nights later <i>Pa-hu-ka&acute;-tawa</i> appeared
to his brother, and said, &ldquo;They are coming. To-morrow
night they will be here spying round the
camp. Be ready for them. You must ask me to
take pity on you, telling me what you want to do,
and I will make you strong, so that you can succeed.
If you want to strike two or three, ask me. If you
want to kill two or three, tell me. You must call me
grandfather.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>151]</a></span>
The next night they danced and asked him to
take pity on them. One young man prayed, saying,
&ldquo;Let me strike nine, and at the tenth let me be
wounded, but let me not die.&rdquo; A second young
man prayed, saying, &ldquo;I want to strike five and capture
the biggest man in the party.&rdquo; Another man
asked him, &ldquo;Let me strike two, and then let me be
killed.&rdquo; To each one who asked a favor of him, he
said, &ldquo;Let it be so.&rdquo; They did not see him, for
there was no fire in the lodge. It was dark.</p>

<p>He said to them, &ldquo;Be ready. To-morrow morning
is the time when the enemy will attack you. I
will send a fog from the north as a warning. They
will come down toward the village, and you must go
out on the plain in front of the village, and have a
skirmish with them. Then draw off, and look toward
the point of bluff which runs down into the
plain on the east end of the battle field. Watch that
point and you will see me. I will appear to you
there. And this shall be a sign to you that it is I
whom you see. When I come up over that point
and turn around, facing to the north, the wind will
change and will come from the south. And when
the wind blows from the south, you make a charge
on them.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>152]</a></span>
So it was. The next morning the enemy made an
attack on them, and came down toward the village.
It was the very day he had said. The warriors went
out on the plain to meet them. They were wondering
in what shape <i>Pa-hu-ka&acute;-tawa</i> would appear to
them, how he would look. On that morning, before
the Sioux appeared, a white fog came down from
the north. Then the Sioux made the attack, and
the people began to look for <i>Pa-hu-ka&acute;-tawa</i>. And
while they were looking toward the bluff, a great
white wolf came up over the point, and stood looking
first one way and then another, and then it turned
around and faced the north. And immediately the
wind changed and blew from the south. When the
wolf appeared, some of the braves doubted whether
it was <i>Pa-hu-ka&acute;-tawa</i>, but when it turned round,
and the wind changed, then they knew that it was
he.</p>

<p>Then they made the charge, and each one of those
who had asked a favor received it. In every case
what <i>Pa-hu-ka&acute;-tawa</i> had promised came true. The
man who had prayed that he might strike nine and
at the tenth be wounded, struck nine and was
wounded at the tenth, but he did not die; the one
who asked to strike five, and to capture the biggest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>153]</a></span>
man in the party, did so. He caught the prisoner,
and overcame him, and put a rope around his neck,
and led him into the village. And when he got him
to the village the women beat the captive with sticks
and clubs, and threw dirt at him, and had lots of fun
with him. The young man who had asked it, killed
two, and then was himself killed. All that <i>Pa-hu-ka&acute;-tawa</i>
had promised came to pass.</p>

<p>The people killed many of the Sioux, and drove
them far, chasing and killing them all day long.
Then they came back to the village, bringing with
them the scalps and the weapons that they had
taken, the bows and the spears, the shields and the
war bonnets. They danced in the village, and sang
and rejoiced. Every one was glad because the
people had won a great victory.</p>

<p>The next night after the day of the battle, <i>Pa-hu-ka&acute;-tawa</i>
came down to his brother&rsquo;s lodge, and told
him that he wanted to speak to him. His brother
awoke all his wives, and sent them out of the lodge,
telling them not to come back until he called them.
Then <i>Pa-hu-ka&acute;-tawa</i> said to his brother, &ldquo;Now, my
brother, you people have seen whether what I say to
you is true or not. You have seen what has happened,
you can judge. Now, brother, I want you to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>154]</a></span>
feel of me all over; nobody else but you to feel of me,
my brother.&rdquo; His brother passed his hands all over
his breast and arms and body and legs. <i>Pa-hu-ka&acute;-tawa</i>
said, &ldquo;Now put your hands on top of my head,
and feel there.&rdquo; He did so, and felt something soft.
<i>Pa-hu-ka&acute;-tawa</i> said, &ldquo;Do you know what that is?
That is the down feathers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then he told the story of his being killed. He
said, &ldquo;That time after I got killed, all kinds of
<i>Nahu&acute;rac</i> took pity on me. The flies and bugs,
the fishes and birds, the deer and the wolves, all
the animals took pity on me, and helped me to
come to life again. They looked all over for my
flesh and my bones, and brought them all together.
One part of me, the top part of my skull, they could
not find. The bugs crept through the ground looking
for it, the fishes swam through the water and
sought it, the flies buzzed about over the sand, and
the deer and wolves hunted for it on the prairie, but
they could not find this piece anywhere. Nor could
they find my brains. Perhaps, when I was killed, the
crows eat them out. When they had gathered the
pieces all together, they laid each piece in its own
place, so that they had the form of a man, and in
place of the top of the skull and the brains they put
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>155]</a></span>
the down feathers. After they had put all the pieces
together, they stood around me, and prayed, and
passed their paws over me, and danced and sang,
and at last I breathed a little. Then they prayed
again, and passed their paws over me, and at length
I breathed regularly. Then I was not dead any
more; I was alive again. Not as a person was I
alive, but as a spirit.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am in every thing; in the wind, in the rain, in
the grass. I go over the whole world. I am the
wind, and I go everywhere all over the world. There
is no one above me but <i>Ti-ra&acute;-wa</i>. He is the only
one I am under. He is the ruler of all. Whenever
any human being on this earth, man, woman or child,
says anything about me, I hear it surely. You must
tell all this to every one, and say to them that if they
are sick or unfortunate, let them pray to me, and I
will heal or help them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now you know that I am living, but I am a
spirit; and whenever you people have a fight with
the Sioux, if you pray to me, and call me by name,
and ask to be brave, and to be helped, I will hear
you. If you wish to be brave, or if you wish not to
be hurt in battle, even though the enemy be right
upon you, and just striking or shooting at you, I will
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>156]</a></span>
protect you. I shall live forever, as long as this
world exists. So long as I come to you, I want you
people to conquer the Sioux all you can, on account
of what they did to me when they killed me and cut
me in pieces. So long as the Sioux come down to
attack you, I want you to conquer them every time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, brother, when I come down to see you, you
must not get tired of me. I want to come down
often to see you, and talk to you, to tell you what is
going to happen, and to warn you whenever the
Sioux are coming down to attack the Skidi. I go
about everywhere, to the camps of the different
bands of Sioux, and I know what the chiefs are saying
in council; when they are talking of sending out
war parties against you. If I come down to you
often, do not get tired of seeing me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He knew himself that his brother would some time
refuse to listen to him, but his brother did not know
it, and he said, &ldquo;I will never get tired of you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Some time after this, the Sioux came down again
to attack the Skidi village. Two days before they
came, <i>Pa-hu-ka&acute;-tawa</i> came down to his brother and
warned him, saying, &ldquo;A big war party of Sioux will
be here day after to-morrow to fight with you. But
I am going to attend to them. On the morning of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>157]</a></span>
the second day from this, tell all the people to be
ready, and to have their horses tied up close to the
lodges, where they can get at them. Then, if you
look up in the sky, you will see thick black clouds,
as if you were going to have a great rain. When you
begin fighting, do not be afraid of the enemy. Do
not be afraid of them; go right up to them; they
will not be able to shoot, their bowstrings will be
wet, and the sinews will stretch and slip off the ends
of the bows. They will not be able to hurt you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On the morning that he had said, the Sioux came
down, and the people went out to meet them. The
sky above was black with clouds. When they began
fighting, a heavy rain commenced to fall, but it did
not rain everywhere, but only just where the Sioux
were. The bowstrings of the Sioux got wet, so that
they could not use them, for the sinews stretched, so
that when they bent their bows the strings slipped
off the ends of the bows, and there was no force to
their arrows. The Skidi overcame the Sioux and
drove them, and the Sioux ran far. The rain followed
the Sioux, and rained over them, but nowhere
else, and the Sioux fled, and the Skidi won a great
victory.</p>

<p>Soon after this, <i>Pa-hu-ka&acute;-tawa</i> came down and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>158]</a></span>
visited his brother, and said to him, &ldquo;My brother,
whenever you have a feast or a council of old men,
you must smoke to me and say, &lsquo;Father, we want
you to help us.&rsquo; Then I will hear you. At the same
time you must pray to <i>Ti-ra&acute;-wa</i>. There is one
above us who is the ruler of all. I do not wish to
be talked about commonly or by common men, but
that whenever you have a feast you should call in
the young men and tell them about me and let them
hear.&rdquo; He did not want his name used irreverently,
nor wish that the story of what he had suffered and
done should be told commonly or for mere amusement.
It is sacred and should be told only at
solemn times.</p>

<p>Some time after this talk with his brother, he came
down again to see him. Another man was living in
his brother&rsquo;s lodge, and on this night his brother was
not there, he was sleeping somewhere else. <i>Pa-hu-ka&acute;-tawa</i>
asked this man where his brother was. He
answered, &ldquo;He is not here to-night, he is sleeping
somewhere else.&rdquo; <i>Pa-hu-ka&acute;-tawa</i> said, &ldquo;Go over
and tell him that I am here, and that I want to see
him.&rdquo; The man went and gave the message to the
brother, who said, &ldquo;I do not want to go. Tell him
I am asleep.&rdquo; The man went back and told
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>159]</a></span>
<i>Pa-hu-ka&acute;-tawa</i> that his brother could not come. He said,
&ldquo;He is asleep.&rdquo; <i>Pa-hu-ka&acute;-tawa</i> sent him back
again, to get the brother. The man went, and said
to the brother, &ldquo;He wants to see you very much.&rdquo;
The brother said, &ldquo;Tell him I can&rsquo;t come; I want to
sleep to-night.&rdquo; The man returned and said, &ldquo;He
does not want to come, he is sleeping.&rdquo; He was
sent back for the brother the third time, to tell the
brother he must come, he was wanted. He sent
word back that he could not, he was too sleepy.
Then <i>Pa-hu-ka&acute;-tawa</i> said, &ldquo;Very well. Go back
and tell him to sleep now, to sleep all he wants. I
told him before that he would get tired of me at last.
Let him sleep all he wants, I will come to him no
more. I can go to some other tribe. This is the
last time I will come. Tell him to sleep. I will
trouble him no more. I am going off, but tell the
people not to forget me; to talk of me sometimes,
and to pray to me, and I will help them and care for
the tribe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So <i>Pa-hu-ka&acute;-tawa</i> went away to the Rees, and the
people knew him no more; after that he never came
down to see them. When the people learned this,
they felt very badly, and were angry at his brother
who would not see him. There was living not long
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>160]</a></span>
ago, among the Rees, an old woman, who, when she
was a girl, had seen and talked to <i>Pa-hu-ka&acute;-tawa</i>.</p>


<p class="break"><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;This is a Skidi story. The Rees have a
story of what <i>Pa-hu-ka&acute;-tawa</i> did after he had come
to them. The Lower Village tribes have a story of a
hero of this same name, which is quite different from
that of the Skidi.</p>

<h3>THE BOY WHO WAS SACRIFICED.</h3>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HERE was a time, far back, when some people
thought that it was good to sacrifice to <i>Ti-ra&acute;-wa</i>
whatever they had that was most precious to
them. The sacrifice of the animal, the burnt offering,
has always been made by all the Pawnees; that
is one of the things handed down from the ruler. It
is very old. The Skidi have always performed the
sacrifice of the captive. Each one of these is sacred
and solemn, but it is not like giving up something
that belongs to you, and that you love. It is a
sacrifice, but it does not cost much.</p>

<p>Many years ago, in the Skidi village on the Loup,
there lived a man, who believed that if he sacrificed
his son to <i>Ti-ra&acute;-wa</i>, it would be a blessing to him.
He thought that if he did this thing, perhaps <i>Ti-ra&acute;-wa</i>
would speak to him face to face, and that he
could talk to him just as two people would talk to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>162]</a></span>
one another, and that in this way he would learn
many things that other people did not understand.
His child was a nice boy about ten years old, strong,
growing up well, and the man loved him. It made
him feel badly to think of killing him. He meditated
long about this, but the more he thought about
it, the more he believed that this sacrifice would
please <i>Ti-ra&acute;-wa</i>. There were many things that he
wanted to understand, and to do; and he thought if
he gave up his son, these good things would come to
him. So he resolved to make the sacrifice.</p>

<p>One morning he started out from the village, and
took the boy with him. They went over to the
Platte. When they got to the river, as they were
walking along, the man took his knife from its sheath,
and caught the boy by the shoulder, and stabbed
him quickly, and cut him open. When the boy was
dead, he threw the body into the river, and then went
back to the village. When he got there, he went into
his lodge and sat down. After a time he said to his
wife, &ldquo;Where is the boy?&rdquo; The woman said, &ldquo;He
went out with you, when you went over to see the
horses.&rdquo; The man answered, &ldquo;No; I went out to
where the horses are feeding, and looked at them,
but he did not go with me.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>163]</a></span>
The man went out, and looked for the boy all
through the village, but he could not find him. At
night when the boy did not come home, they began
to get frightened, and for two days they hunted for
the boy, and at last they got the old crier to call out
for him from the top of the lodge, and ask if any one
had seen him, but none of the people knew what had
become of the boy. Now the mother was mourning,
and the father pretended to feel very badly. They
could not find the boy; and soon after this the tribe
started on the summer hunt, and the father and
mother went with them. The village made a good
hunt, killing plenty of buffalo, and made much dried
meat.</p>

<p>After the boy had been thrown into the river, he
floated down with the current, sometimes turning
over and over in the swift water, and sometimes
grounding for a little while on a sand bar, and then
being floated off again, and being carried further
down. At length he came near to the place where
the whirlpool is, under the bluff at <i>Pa-h&#365;k&acute;</i>, where is
the lodge of the <i>Nahu&acute;rac</i>. There were two buzzards
sitting on the bluff, just above this place, and
as they sat there, one of them stretched out his neck
and looked up the river, and after he had looked, he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>164]</a></span>
said to the other, &ldquo;I see a body.&rdquo; Then both the
buzzards flew down to where the boy was floating in
the water, and got down under him, and raised him
on their backs, and lifted him up out of the water,
and flew up to the bluff, carrying the boy on their
backs, and placed him on the ground on top of the
bluff over the big cave, which is the home of the
<i>Nahu&acute;rac</i>. In this lodge were all kinds of animals,
and all kinds of birds. There were bears, and mountain
lions, and buffalo, and elk, and beaver, and
otter, and deer; all kinds of animals, great and small,
and all kinds of birds.</p>

<p>There is a little bird, smaller than a pigeon. Its
back is blue, and its breast white, and its head is
spotted. It flies swiftly over the water, and when it
sees a fish, it dives down into the water to catch it.
This bird is a servant or a messenger for the <i>Nahu&acute;rac</i>.
Such a bird came flying by just as the buzzards put
the body on the ground, and he stopped and looked
at it. When he saw how it was&mdash;for he knew all
that had happened&mdash;he flew down into the lodge
and told the <i>Nahu&acute;rac</i> about the boy. The bird
said, &ldquo;There is a boy up here on the hill. He is
dead, and he is poor, and I want to have him
brought to life again.&rdquo; Then he told the <i>Nahu&acute;rac</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>165]</a></span>
all the things that had happened. When the messenger
bird had done speaking, the <i>Nahu&acute;rac</i> earnestly
counselled together for a long time to decide
what should be done, and each one made a
speech, giving his opinion about the matter, but
they could not make up their minds what ought to
be done.</p>

<p>The little bird was coaxing the <i>Nahu&acute;rac</i>, and saying,
&ldquo;Come, now, we want to save his life.&rdquo; But the
<i>Nahu&acute;rac</i> could not decide. At last the chief of the
<i>Nahu&acute;rac</i> said, &ldquo;No, messenger, we cannot decide
this here. You will have to go to the other council
lodges, and see what they say about it.&rdquo; The bird
said, &ldquo;I am going,&rdquo; and flew swiftly out of the lodge
and up the river, till he came to the <i>Nahu&acute;rac</i> lodge
near the Lone Tree. When he got there, he told them
all about the boy, and said that the council at
<i>Pa-h&#365;k&acute;</i> could not decide what should be done. The
<i>Nahu&acute;rac</i> here talked, and at last they said, &ldquo;We
cannot decide. The council at <i>Pa-h&#365;k&acute;</i> must decide.&rdquo;
Then the bird went to the lodge on the Loup, and
the <i>Nahu&acute;rac</i> there said that they could not decide
Then he went to <i>Kitz-a-witz-&#365;k</i>, and to <i>Pa-h&#363;r&acute;</i>; and
at each place the <i>Nahu&acute;rac</i> considered and talked
about it, and then said, &ldquo;We cannot decide what
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>166]</a></span>
shall be done. The council at <i>Pa-h&#365;k&acute;</i> must decide
for themselves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At last, after he had visited all the council lodges
of the <i>Nahu&acute;rac</i>, the bird flew swiftly back to the
lodge at <i>Pa-h&#365;k&acute;</i>, and told them there what the
animals at the other lodges had said. In the council
of the <i>Nahu&acute;rac</i> at <i>Pa-h&#365;k&acute;</i>, there were four chiefs,
who sat there as judges to determine such matters
as this, after they had all been talked over, and to
decide what should be done. When the messenger
bird came back, and told the <i>Nahu&acute;rac</i> what the
other councils had said, these judges considered for
a time, and then spoke together, and at length the
chief of the judges said to the bird, &ldquo;Now, messenger,
we have concluded that we will not decide
this question ourselves. You decide it, and say what
shall be done.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The messenger was not long in deciding. He did
not hesitate. He said, &ldquo;I want this boy brought
back to life.&rdquo; Then all the <i>Nahu&acute;rac</i> stood up, and
went to where the boy lay, and stood around him
and prayed, and at last the boy breathed once, and
then after a little while he breathed again, and at
last he came to life and sat up. He looked about
and saw all these animals standing around him, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>167]</a></span>
he wondered. He said to himself, &ldquo;Why, my father
stabbed me, and killed me, and now here I am
among this great crowd of animals. What does this
mean?&rdquo; He was surprised.</p>

<p>The <i>Nahu&acute;rac</i> all went back into the lodge, and
took the boy with them. When all were seated in
the lodge, the four judges talked to each other, and
the chief one stood up, and said, &ldquo;Now, my people,
we have brought this boy back to life, but he is poor,
and we must do something for him. Let us teach
him all we know, and make him one of us.&rdquo; Then
the <i>Nahu&acute;rac</i> all made a noise. They were glad.
Then they began to sing and they danced. They
taught the boy all their secrets, and all their ways.
They taught him how to cut a man open and cure
him again, and how to shoot an arrow through a man
and then cure him, and how to cut a man&rsquo;s tongue
out and then to put it back, and how to make well a
broken leg, and many other things. After they had
done all these things, they said to the boy, &ldquo;Now we
have brought you back to life, and have taught you
all these things, so that you are one of us. Now you
must stop with us one season. Your people have
gone off on the summer hunt. You must stay with
us until the autumn. Then you can go back to your
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>168]</a></span>
people.&rdquo; So the boy stayed with the <i>Nahu&acute;rac</i> in
their lodge.</p>

<p>At length the Skidi had returned from the hunt
with plenty of dried meat. Soon after this, the <i>Nahu&acute;rac</i>
said one day to the boy, &ldquo;Your people have
got back from the hunt. Now you can go back to
the village. Go back and get a lot of nice dried
meat, and bring it back to us here, and we will have
a feast.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boy went home to the village. He got there
in the night, and went to his father&rsquo;s lodge, and went
in. There was a little fire burning in the lodge. It
was nearly out, and gave only a little light, but he
knew the place where his mother slept. He went up
to her, and put out his hand and touched her, and
pushed her a little. She awoke, and sat up and
looked at him, and he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve come back.&rdquo; When
she saw him, and heard him speak, she was very
much surprised, and her heart was glad to see her
boy again. She called to his father, and he woke
up. When he saw the boy he was afraid, for he
thought it was a ghost. The boy told them nothing
of what had happened, or where he had been. He
just said, &ldquo;I have come back again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the morning all the people were surprised to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>169]</a></span>
hear that he had come back, and to see him, and
they stood around looking at him, and asking him
questions, but he said nothing. The next day the
people still questioned him, and at last the boy said,
&ldquo;I have been all summer with friends, with people
who have been good to me. I should like to take
them a present of some nice dried meat, so that we
can have a feast.&rdquo; The people said that this was
good. They picked out four strong horses, and
loaded them with dried meat, the nicest pieces. The
boy&rsquo;s father gave some of it, and all the other people
brought pieces and put them on the horses, until
they had big loads. They sent two young men with
the boy, to help him load and drive the horses, and
they started to go to the <i>Nahu&acute;rac</i> lodge at <i>Pa-h&#365;k&acute;</i>.</p>

<p>When they had come pretty near the place, the
boy sent the young men back to the village, and he
went on alone, driving the pack-horses before him.
When he reached the home of the <i>Nahu&acute;rac</i>, he unloaded
the horses, and turned them loose, and then
went into the lodge. When he went in, and when
the <i>Nahu&acute;rac</i> saw him, they all made a hissing
noise. They were glad to see him. The boy brought
into the lodge all the dried meat, and they had a
great feast. After the feast they had a doctors&rsquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>170]</a></span>
dance, and the boy was made a doctor, and again
was taught all that the <i>Nahu&acute;rac</i> knew. After that
he could do many wonderful things. He could
sometimes go to a man that had been dead for a
day, and then bring him back to life.</p>

<p>No one ever knew what the father had done, for
the boy never told any one. He knew that he could
never have learned all these wonderful things unless
his father had sacrificed him.</p>

<h3>THE SNAKE BROTHER.</h3>


<p><span class="dropcap">O</span>NE time, long ago, a big party of Pawnees went
on the warpath down to the south. They could
find no enemies anywhere, and they went a long way
south. In this party were two brothers, poor boys,
and one day as they were traveling along, apart from
the others, in a piece of woods where it was very
thick, they got lost. When they found that they were
lost, they tried to go back to the camp, but they
could not find the others, and at last gave up looking
for them and started to go back north to their
home. They had no food with them, and were looking
about for something to kill, so that they might
eat. As they were going along, they came upon a
dead buffalo that had been killed some time, and
there was nothing of it left but the bones, so they
took some of the marrow bones, and carried them
along with them, until they made a camp.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>172]</a></span>
Not far beyond here they stopped to rest. There
was a tree growing near where they stopped, and as
they looked up into it, they saw a squirrel run up the
tree. One of the brothers caught up his bow and
arrows, and the other said, &ldquo;Oh, kill him, kill him,
quick.&rdquo; The boy shot and killed it, and they
skinned it, and roasted it over the fire. While they
were cooking it the elder brother said, &ldquo;I wonder if
it is good to eat the marrow and the squirrel
together.&rdquo; The younger said, &ldquo;No, it is not good to
do so. This is not real meat.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> The elder thought
the two kinds of food would be good together, and
they disputed about this for some time. The elder
brother kept coaxing the younger to eat the squirrel
and the marrow together, but the younger said, &ldquo;Oh,
brother, I do not like to do this. To me it does not
seem good. But if you wish to do it, why don&rsquo;t
you?&rdquo; The elder said, &ldquo;I think I will do so;&rdquo; and
he did so, taking a bite of squirrel, and then a bite of
marrow. He said, &ldquo;It is nice, you had better take
some.&rdquo; But the younger brother would not. He
ate only the marrow. After they had eaten they did
not go on further, but slept there.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_10_10" id="Footnote_10_10"></a><a href="#FNanchor_10_10"><span class="label">[10]</span></a>
Like buffalo meat, or elk or deer.</p>
</div>

<p>About the middle of the night, the elder brother
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>173]</a></span>
felt a noise in his feet, and he sat up and felt of
his legs and feet, and he found that his feet were
stuck together, and were beginning to get round,
like a snake, and had a rattle on the end of them,
and that his legs were round and like the tail of a
great big rattlesnake. He reached over, and put his
hands on his brother, and shook him, and said to
him, &ldquo;Get up. There is something the matter with
me.&rdquo; The younger brother woke up, and felt of his
brother, and found how it was; as if he was changing
into a snake, beginning at his feet. When he
saw this he felt very badly. Then the older brother
began to talk to the younger, and to give him good
advice, for he felt very sad.</p>

<p>He said, &ldquo;Now I am going to die, and leave my
young brother here alone on this prairie. He is so
young, he will not be able to find his way home, and
he must die, too. Surely this has happened because
I ate the marrow and the squirrel together.&rdquo; While he
was talking, the change had moved up to his waist.</p>

<p>After a little while he got more hopeful, and he
said, &ldquo;Now, brother, I know that you will get home
safely. I will protect you. I know that I am going
to be a snake, and I shall stay right here. You see
that hole,&rdquo; and he pointed to a hole in the bank.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>174]</a></span>
&ldquo;When I have changed into a snake, take me in your
arms, and carry me over to that hole. I am going to
stay there forever. That will be my home, for that
is the house of the snakes. When you go back
home, you must tell our father and mother how it
was, and whenever you want to go on the warpath,
take a big party and come down this way, and come
right here, to this very place, and you will see me,
for I shall be here. Now, brother, when you go back
home, some time after you have reached home, I
want you to come back all alone; come right here.
You know what I told you; do not be afraid of me.
I believe this was to happen to me, and I could not
help it. After you have once come all alone, then
the second time you may bring some others with
you, but the first time come alone.&rdquo; So he talked
to his brother, and as he spoke the change kept
going on. While it was moving up his body, until it
got to his head, he was still like a man in his mind,
but all his body was like a great big snake. Then
he spoke to his brother, and said, &ldquo;Now, brother,
cover up my head with the robe, and after a little
while take it off again.&rdquo; The younger brother, did
as he was told, and when, after a while, he took the
robe off, there he saw an immense snake&rsquo;s head as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>175]</a></span>
broad as his two hands. The elder brother had
completely changed into a snake.</p>

<p>The young man took the snake in his arms, and
carried him over to the hole, and put him on the
ground by it. He felt very sad to go away and leave
his brother here. Before he started, he spoke good
words to the snake, and said, &ldquo;Now, brother, I am
going home, and I ask you to take pity on me, and
to protect me. I do not know the country I am
going through, and you must take care of me. Do
not forget the promises you have made me.&rdquo; After
he had spoken he did not wait to see the snake go
into the hole, but started on his journey, and went
off toward his home.</p>

<p>When he reached the village, he told all these
things to his father and his mother. He said to all
his relations, &ldquo;Do not mourn for him. He is alive
and he is well. The only trouble is, that he is in the
shape of a snake.&rdquo; After he had been home ten
days, he told his mother to make for him five pairs
of moccasins, that he was going on the warpath for
himself. His mother did so, and he stuffed them
full of parched corn, and took a little sack of
pounded buffalo meat on his back, and started back
to see his brother.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>176]</a></span>
It took him seven days fast traveling to get to
where he left the snake. When he had come near
the place, he saw there the hole where he had left
his brother. He went up close to the hole and began
to speak. He said, &ldquo;Brother, I am here. I have
come on the warpath, and I am here to see you.
You told me to come, and to come alone. I have
done what you bade me, and am here. Now, brother,
remember to keep your promises. I want to see you
this afternoon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He stood there a little while, and then there began
in the hole a rattling and a rustling and scraping
noise, and presently dust began to roll out, and then
out of the hole came this great big snake, which was
his brother. First came out this great snake, and
after him many other large ones came out, and crept
all about, but the great snake, his brother, lay just
outside the hole. The boy went up to the big snake
and took it in his arms, and hugged it, and spoke to
it, and the snake put out its tongue, as if it were kissing
him. Then the boy put it down on the ground,
and all the other snakes came back, and went in the
hole, and after them all, last, the big snake went in
the hole.</p>

<p>Then the boy left this place, and went on a little
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>177]</a></span>
further, and about sunset he came to a little creek,
and here he lay down and slept. In the night he
dreamed of his brother, who spoke to him and said,
&ldquo;Now, brother, I am glad that you have come down
to see me, as I told you to. And now I say to you,
be brave. Have courage. To-morrow morning
when you awake, dress yourself up as if you were
going to fight. Paint your face, put feathers in your
head, make yourself ready to fight.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The next morning the boy woke up, and as the
snake had told him in the dream, so he did. He
painted his face and tied feathers in his head, and
dressed himself up for the fight. Then he started
on. Pretty soon he came to a little hill, and as he
looked over it, he saw people coming toward him;
people and many horses. He thought they were
Sioux, and when he saw them, he went back a little,
to find a place where he could hide. He went back
to the little creek where he had slept, and there he
sat down in the brush. When he had hidden himself
in the brush, he waited; and the people came
straight toward where he had hidden himself, and
camped just below where he was. After a little
while he raised himself up and looked at them, and
saw only two persons, and presently he saw that one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>178]</a></span>
of them was a woman. He watched for a long time,
looking about to see if there were any more, but he
could see only these two. Then he considered what
he should do. While he was thinking, it came to
him what the snake brother had said to him in the
night, and then he knew what to do.</p>

<p>He crept slowly along through the brush toward
their camp, and when he got close to them, about
twenty yards distant, he raised up his head and
looked. He saw the woman cooking, and there
were hanging on a little tree the man&rsquo;s bow and
arrows and shield and spear, but the man he could
not see. He was lying down asleep somewhere near
by. The boy waited and watched. He was excited,
and his heart was pounding against his ribs. After
a little while, the woman left the fire and walked
away toward the horses. Perhaps her husband had
said to her, &ldquo;The horses are going off, you had better
go and turn them back.&rdquo; When she went toward
the horses, the boy was going to run up to the man
and kill him, but before doing so he changed his
mind; for he thought, &ldquo;If I kill him, perhaps the
woman will get on a horse, and ride away, driving
the other horses with her.&rdquo; So he waited until the
woman had come back. When she had returned to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>179]</a></span>
the fire, he ran up toward her, and she heard him
coming, and ran to wake her husband; but just as
she got to him, the boy was by her side. He shot
two arrows into the man and killed him and counted
<i>coup</i> on him, and captured the woman. He took the
whole scalp of his enemy&rsquo;s head.</p>

<p>Then he took the woman and went down to where
the horses were, and they got on two of them, and
rode back to where his brother, the snake, lived,
driving the horses before them. Just before they
got to the hole, the boy took his lariat and caught a
nice spotted horse and a mule, and tied them up to
the tree, and called up the woman, and tied her up
against the tree as tight as he could tie her. When
he had done this, he went up to the hole and began
to talk. He said, &ldquo;Oh, my brother, I see now that
what you have promised me comes true. I did what
you told me. Now here are these two animals and
the woman; I give them to you for being good to
me. They are yours. I am glad for what you have
done for me this day.&rdquo; When he had finished saying
this he spoke again, saying, &ldquo;Now, brother, I
want to see you once more. I am going off, and I
want to see you before I go.&rdquo; After a little while
he heard again the rattling sound in the hole, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>180]</a></span>
saw the dust coming out of it, and then his brother
came out of the hole, and then afterward the smaller
snakes; and these all went down to the tree and
climbed up into it. The tree was thick with them.
Then the boy did as he had done before. He went
close to the hole, and took his brother up in his arms
and hugged him, and the great snake thrust out his
tongue, as if kissing him. Then the boy spoke again
and said, &ldquo;Now, brother, I am going away, and I
give you these two animals and this woman to keep.
They are yours.&rdquo; Then he started for his home,
and after a long time he arrived at the village.</p>

<p>After a time, he determined to start off again on
the warpath, and this time he took a party with him.
He had told the whole tribe what had happened, and
how his brother had protected and helped him; and
he said to those warriors who were going with
him, &ldquo;Let each one of you take a present with you
for my brother; some beads or eagle feathers or
some tobacco as an offering, so that he may help
you.&rdquo; They started south to go to the place where
his brother lived. When they got there, the young
man said to the others, &ldquo;Now you must, each one of
you, give something to my brother. Call him by his
kin name, and ask him to help you, and to make you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>181]</a></span>
successful; and leave the things before the hole.&rdquo;
They did as he said, and when they had made their
presents, they went by. They saw nothing, for the
brother did not call out the great snake.</p>

<p>Two or three days after they had passed the place,
they found a camp of Sioux, and took a lot of horses
and killed some of the enemy. Then they went
back, and when they came to the snake&rsquo;s home, they
took a horse and led it up near the hole and killed
it, and gave it to him, and left the scalps at the
mouth of the hole as presents to him. When they
reached the village, there was great joy and a good
time. They had all kinds of dances, for they were
glad that the war party had killed some Sioux.</p>

<p>After that another war party started out, and the
brother said to them, &ldquo;Go straight to my brother,
and make him a present, and ask him to give you
good luck, and you will be successful.&rdquo; And it
happened as he had said.</p>

<p>The brother was always fortunate in war. He
became a chief and was very rich, having many
horses. Ever after that time, when he took the lead
of a war party, all the poor men would come and say,
&ldquo;I want to go with you.&rdquo; They knew that his brother
was a snake, and would give him good luck.</p>

<h3>O&acute;RE-KA-RAHR.</h3>


<p><span class="dropcap">A</span> LONG time ago, as the tribe were on their
summer hunt, a man and his wife got to
quarreling. They had a child, a boy about ten
months old. It was while they were traveling along,
going from one camp to another, that they began to
quarrel. At length the wife became very angry, and
threw the baby to the man, saying, &ldquo;You take that
baby. It belongs to you, for it is a man child. I am
not going to nurse it for you any longer.&rdquo; Then
she went away.</p>

<p>The man took the child and carried it along with
him. He felt very badly, both on his own account
and on account of his child. He was so unhappy
that he almost wanted to kill himself. He was so
poor-minded because it was a disgrace that he, being
a man, should be obliged to take care of his child
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>183]</a></span>
until it was grown up, and he had no female relatives
to whom he could turn it over to be reared.
So he was very unhappy, and determined to leave
the tribe and wander off alone, far from his people.</p>

<p>He did so. He carried the child on his back, as a
woman does. When it cried for its mother&rsquo;s milk,
he had none to give it. He could only cry with it.
He hated to kill the child, or to leave it behind to
die on the prairie. He wandered off to the south.
He traveled on for a time, until he came near to
where the buffalo were. By this time, the child had
changed from a very fat baby to a very thin one,
because it had not been nursed. When he got to
the buffalo, he killed a cow, and took its udder, and
while it was fresh he let the child suck it, until it
became sour. Then he killed another cow, and did
the same thing. In every way he did the best he
could to nourish the child. Sometimes he would get
a slice of meat, and half cook it, and let the child
suck the juice. The child began to improve, and to
get a little stronger. In this way he supported it
for quite a long time, and it did pretty well, and at
last it got used to this food, and became strong and
well. By this time he had gone a long way.</p>

<p>At length he found that the child could sit up
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>184]</a></span>
alone. Then he began to give it all sorts of playthings,
so that it could amuse itself. First he made
for it a little bow and some arrows, and taught it
how to use them. He made other things for the
child to play with, and at last it got to be contented
playing alone. Then the father would leave the
child for a few minutes, and go off a little way, perhaps
to the top of a hill near by, to look off over the
country, but he would look back at the child every
few steps to see that it was all right. When he would
come back he would find the child safe, playing, well
contented. After a while he got so that he would
leave it for about an hour, and when he came back,
find it safe and contented, playing. By this time the
child had begun to walk. Finally the father went
off once for half a day, and when he came back, he
found the child playing about safe. It did not seem
to mind much about the father being absent. About
this time he killed a buffalo cow, and made some
dried meat, and put it in a certain place, and told
the child when it was hungry to go there and get a
a piece.</p>

<p>He now went off and was gone a whole day, and
when he came back at night the child was safe.
Finally he made his preparations and went off to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>185]</a></span>
stay over night, and be gone two days. He did so,
and when he came back, the boy was asleep. A
second time he went away and was absent for two
days, going quite a long distance. When he came
back he found that the child was painted with white
clay. The father thought this was strange. He said
to himself, &ldquo;Something must have come and talked
to my child, and is taking care of him while I am
gone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When he came back the third time after a two
days&rsquo; journey, he found that the child had about his
neck a string of <i>pa&acute;hut</i>.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> The fourth long journey
he took lasted three days, and when he returned, he
found his boy still wearing this same string of beads,
and with a feather tied in his head. Now his father
knew that something was looking after his child
while he was away, and when he went off, he would
pray for the child. He would say, &ldquo;<i>No&acute;-a</i>, whatever
it is that is taking pity on my child, also take pity on
me.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_11_11" id="Footnote_11_11"></a><a href="#FNanchor_11_11"><span class="label">[11]</span></a>
Wild currants strung like beads.</p>
</div>

<p>The child had now grown so large that it could
talk with him, and one day it said, &ldquo;Father, you go
away, and you be gone for four days; I will be all
right here. When you come back you will find me
safe.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>186]</a></span>
The man went. He started to go way down south,
to be gone for four days. After he had been gone
two days and two nights, he saw a signal smoke and
went toward it. As he raised up his head and
peeped over a hill before crossing it, he saw, far off, a
lot of people and horses coming toward the river
which lay between him and them. He lay on the
hill a long time, watching to see where they would
camp. When they had made camp, he went into a
ravine, and crept down close to the camp, until he
could see that it was just one lodge, and that about
it were a whole herd of horses. He waited until
evening, and then went over to the lodge. It was
after dark when he went. The lodge was all surrounded
by horses; everywhere nothing but horses,
there were so many. He crept close to the lodge,
and looked in through an opening by the door, and
saw lying down opposite the door a great big man,
and on either side a woman; only three persons in
all. As he looked at these persons, he thought he
recognized one of the women. He kept looking at
her, and at last he remembered who she was, and
that she had been captured long ago from the Pawnees.
Her people were still living. The man was a
Comanche.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>187]</a></span>
While the Pawnee was watching, the man inside
the lodge asked for something, and the captive
woman stood up to go out of the lodge, and the
Pawnee stepped to one side, out of sight. The
woman came out into the darkness, and went out
among the horses. The Pawnee stepped up behind
her very softly, and put his hand on her shoulder,
and said to her in Pawnee, &ldquo;Friend, do you belong
to my tribe?&rdquo; The woman started to scream, but
he put his hand on her mouth, and said to her, &ldquo;Be
quiet. Keep still. Do not call out.&rdquo; She answered
him, &ldquo;Yes, I belong to your tribe.&rdquo; Then she said
in a very low voice that shook, for she was afraid,
&ldquo;Do you belong to my tribe?&rdquo; The man said,
&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; Then he asked her, &ldquo;Who is that other
woman that I see in the lodge?&rdquo; She answered
him, &ldquo;She also belongs to our tribe, and is a prisoner.&rdquo;
Then the man said, &ldquo;You just wait and keep
still. I am going to kill that man.&rdquo; The woman
said, &ldquo;That is good. That is good. This man is
the biggest man of all the Comanches. He has
come first to this place, and all the rest of the
Comanches are coming here to meet him. I am
glad that my people are living, and that I am going
back to see them once more. Do not fail to kill
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>188]</a></span>
him. I will tell the other woman to be ready, that
our friend is here, and we will wait and watch.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When the woman went into the lodge, she whispered
to the other woman, and said, &ldquo;Be ready. A
friend who belongs to our tribe is here. Take your
hatchet, and be prepared to help to kill our husband.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The two women waited, and the Pawnee made
ready to shoot the Comanche with his bow and
arrow. The woman had said to him, &ldquo;Push aside
the door a little and be ready.&rdquo; He made a little
bit of an opening by the door, just big enough to let
an arrow pass through, and when the time came he
let it go. <i>U&acute;-ra-r&#299;sh!</i> the arrow flew straight, and
pierced the Comanche through the heart. So he
died, and the Pawnee counted <i>coup</i> on him and took
his scalp.</p>

<p>The women felt so glad to meet a friend that they
put their arms around the man and patted him.
They were going back home to see their relations.
They asked him, &ldquo;How many of you are here?&rdquo;
He answered, &ldquo;I am alone.&rdquo; They were surprised.</p>

<p>They took down the lodge, and packed everything
on the horses, and drove off the herd, leaving the
dead body of the enemy in the camp. All night
they traveled, and all the next day; and as they were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>189]</a></span>
going, he told them how it came about that he was
alone. They told him that there were about three
hundred head of horses in the herd that they had
with them. When they had come pretty close to
where he had left the child, he told them about
the boy being there all alone; and the women just
ran their horses to get to the boy; whichever got
there first, he should be hers. When they came to
the boy, they took him in their arms and petted him,
and took him as their own.</p>

<p>Now the father was no longer sad. He had recovered
two captured women, had killed his enemy,
and had taken a lot of horses.</p>

<p>They went on, and traveled far, and at length,
one night, they came to the Pawnee tribe, and
camped with them. The horses just surrounded the
lodge, you could just see the top of it over their
backs. The next morning all the people wondered
who these strangers could be. They found out that
the man and child, who were lost, had returned,
and with them two women, captured long ago by
the Comanches. So there was great joy in the tribe.
Then the man gave his relations many horses. In
those days the Pawnees had not many horses, and it
seems that this man brought good luck in horses to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>190]</a></span>
the tribe. Ever since that time they have had many
horses. The mother of the child came to see it, she
was so glad it was alive, but she was whipped out of
the lodge.</p>

<p>The child grew to be a man, and was wealthy.
After he had grown up, he told his father that ever
since he could remember anything, a buck deer had
talked to him, and taken care of him; that it had
saved them, and brought them good fortune. In
order that the <i>O&acute;re-ka-rahr</i> might be remembered,
he established a dance, called the deer dance, which
has been kept up to this day.</p>

<p>Many wonderful things happened to this same
young man. Once he went on a war party against
the Cheyennes, and stole some horses from them.
The Cheyennes followed and overtook them, and
they had a great fight. The first man killed was this
young man. He was very brave, and the Cheyennes
cut him up into small pieces, but that night it lightened
and thundered and rained, and soon after the
storm was over, the young man came walking into
camp alive. He was all scarred over, where he had
been cut up, but he had come to life because the
deer had looked after him. He lived long to show
the scars of the battles he had been through.</p>



<p class="padtop"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>191]</a></span></p>

<h3>THE GHOST BRIDE.</h3>


<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>N a place where we used to have a village, a
young woman died just before the tribe started
on the hunt. When she died they dressed her up in
her finest clothes, and buried her, and soon after
this the tribe started on the hunt.</p>

<p>A party of young men had gone off to visit another
tribe, and they did not get back until after this
girl had died and the tribe had left the village.
Most of this party did not go back to the village,
but met the tribe and went with them on the hunt.
Among the young men who had been away was one
who had loved this girl who had died. He went
back alone to the village. It was empty and silent,
but before he reached it, he could see, far off, some
one sitting on top of a lodge. When he came near,
he saw that it was the girl he loved. He did not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>192]</a></span>
know that she had died, and he wondered to see her
there alone, for the time was coming when he would
be her husband and she his wife. When she saw
him coming, she came down from the top of the
lodge and went inside. When he came close to her,
he spoke and said, &ldquo;Why are you here alone in the
village?&rdquo; She answered him, &ldquo;They have gone off
on the hunt. I was sulky with my relations, and
they went off and left me behind.&rdquo; The man wanted
her now to be his wife, but the girl said to him, &ldquo;No,
not yet, but later we will be married.&rdquo; She said to
him, &ldquo;You must not be afraid. To-night there will
be dances here; the ghosts will dance.&rdquo; This is an
old custom of the Pawnees. When they danced they
used to go from one lodge to another, singing, dancing
and hallooing. So now, when the tribe had gone
and the village was deserted, the ghosts did this.
He could hear them coming along the empty streets,
and going from one lodge to another. They came
into the lodge where he was, and danced about,
and whooped and sang, and sometimes they almost
touched him, and he came pretty near being scared.</p>

<p>The next day, the young man persuaded the girl
to go on with him, and follow the tribe, to join it on
the hunt. They started to travel together, and she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>193]</a></span>
promised him that she would surely be his wife, but
not until the time came. They overtook the tribe;
but before they got to the camp, the girl stopped.
She said, &ldquo;Now we have arrived, but you must go
first to the village, and prepare a place for me.
Where I sleep, let it be behind a curtain. For four
days and four nights I must remain behind this curtain.
Do not speak of me. Do not mention my
name to any one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The young man left her there and went into the
camp. When he got to his lodge, he told a woman,
one of his relations, to go out to a certain place and
bring in a woman, who was waiting there for him.
His relative asked him, &ldquo;Who is the woman?&rdquo; And
to avoid speaking her name, he told who were her
father and mother. His relation, in surprise, said,
&ldquo;It cannot be that girl, for she died some days before
we started on the hunt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When the woman went to look for the girl she
could not find her. The girl had disappeared. The
young man had disobeyed her, and had told who she
was. She had told him that she must stay behind a
curtain for four days, and that no one must know
who she was. Instead of doing what she had said,
he told who she was, and the girl disappeared
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>194]</a></span>
because she was a ghost. If he had obeyed the girl,
she would have lived a second time upon earth.
That same night this young man died in sleep.</p>

<p>Then the people were convinced that there must
be a life after this one.</p>

<h3>THE BOY WHO SAW A-TI&acute;-US.</h3>


<p><span class="dropcap">M</span>ANY years ago the Pawnees started on their
winter hunt. The buffalo were scarce, and
the people could get hardly any meat. It was very
cold, and the snow lay deep on the ground. The
tribe traveled southward, and crossed the Republican,
but still found no buffalo. They had eaten all the
dried meat, and all the corn that they had brought
with them, and now they were starving. The sufferings
of the people were great, and the little ones
began to die of hunger. Now they began to eat their
robes, and <i>parfleches</i>, and moccasins.</p>

<p>There was in the tribe a boy about sixteen years
old, who was all alone, and was very poor. He had
no relations who could take care of him, and he lived
with a woman whose husband had been killed by the
Sioux. She had two children, a boy and a girl; and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>196]</a></span>
she had a good heart, and was sorry for the poor
boy. In this time of famine, these people had
scarcely anything to eat, and whenever the boy got
hold of any food, he gave it to the woman, who
divided it among them all.</p>

<p>The tribe kept traveling southward looking for
buffalo, but they had to go very slowly, because they
were all so weak. Still they found no buffalo, and
each day the young men that were sent out to look
for them climbed the highest hills, and came back at
night, and reported that they could only see the
white prairie covered with snow. All this time little
ones were dying of hunger, and the men and women
were growing weaker every day.</p>

<p>The poor boy suffered with the rest, and at last he
became so weak that he hardly could keep up with
the camp, even though it moved very slowly. One
morning he was hardly able to help the old woman
pack the lodge, and after it had been packed, he
went back to the fire, and sat down beside it, and
watched the camp move slowly off across the valley,
and up over the bluffs. He thought to himself,
&ldquo;Why should I go on? I can&rsquo;t keep up for more
than a day or two longer anyhow. I may as well
stay here and die.&rdquo; So he gathered together the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>197]</a></span>
ends of the sticks that lay by the fire, and put them
on the coals, and spread his hands over the blaze,
and rubbed them together, and got warm, and then
lay down by the fire, and pretty soon he went to
sleep.</p>

<p>When he came to himself, it was about the middle
of the day, and as he looked toward the sky he saw
two spots there between him and the sun, and he
wondered what they were. As he looked at them
they became larger and larger, and at last he could
see that they were birds; and by and by, as they
came still nearer, he saw that they were two swans.
The swans kept coming lower and lower, and at last
they alighted on the ground right by the fire, and
walked up to where the boy lay. He was so weak
he could not get up, and they came to him, one on
each side, and stooped down, and pushed their
shoulders under him, and raised him up and put him
on their backs, and then spread their broad wings,
and flew away upward. Then the boy went to sleep
again.</p>

<p>When he awoke he was lying on the ground before
a very big lodge. It was large and high, and on it
were painted pictures of many strange animals,
in beautiful colors. The boy had never seen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>198]</a></span>
such a fine lodge. The air was warm here,
and he felt stronger than before. He tried to raise
himself up, and after trying once or twice he got on
his feet, and walked to the door of the lodge, and
went in. Opposite the door sat <i>A-ti&acute;-us</i>. He was
very large and very handsome, and his face was kind
and gentle. He was dressed in beautiful clothes,
and wore a white buffalo robe. Behind him, from
the lodge poles, hung many strange weapons.
Around the lodge on each side sat many chiefs, and
doctors, and warriors. They all wore fine clothes of
white buckskin, embroidered with beautifully colored
quills. Their robes were all of beaver skin, very
beautiful.</p>

<p>When the boy entered the lodge, <i>A-ti&acute;-us</i> said to
him, &ldquo;<i>Looah, pi-rau&acute;, we-t&#365;s s&#363;ks-pit</i>&mdash;Welcome, my
son, and sit down.&rdquo; And he said to one of the warriors,
&ldquo;Give him something to eat.&rdquo; The warrior
took down a beautifully painted sack of <i>parfleche</i>, and
took his knife from its sheath, and cut off a piece of
dried meat about as big as one&rsquo;s two fingers, and a
piece of fat about the same size, and gave them to
the boy. The boy, who was so hungry, thought
that this was not very much to give to one who was
starving, but took it, and began to eat. He put the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>199]</a></span>
fat on the lean, and cut the pieces off, and ate for a
long time. But after he had eaten for a long time,
the pieces of meat remained the same size; and he
ate all that he wanted, and then put the pieces down,
still the same size.</p>

<p>After the boy had finished eating, <i>A-ti&acute;-us</i> spoke to
him. He told him that he had seen the sufferings of
his people, and had been sorry for them; and then
he told the boy what to do. So he kept the boy
there for a little while longer, and gave him some
fine new clothing and weapons, and then he told one
of the warriors to send the boy back; and the warrior
led him out of the lodge to where the swans
were standing near the entrance, and the boy got on
to their backs. Then the warrior put his hand on
his face, and pressed his eyelids together, and the
boy went to sleep. And by and by the boy awoke,
and found himself alone by the fire. The fire had
gone out, but the ground was still covered with snow,
and it was very cold.</p>

<p>Now the boy felt strong, and he stood up, and
started, running along the trail which the camp had
taken. That night after dark he overtook the camp,
for they traveled very slowly, and he walked through
the village till he came to the lodge where the woman
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>200]</a></span>
was, and went in. She was surprised to see him in
his new clothes, and looking so well and strong, and
told him to sit down. There was a little fire in the
lodge, and the boy could see that the woman was
cutting up something into small pieces with her
knife.</p>

<p>The boy said to her, &ldquo;What are you doing?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She answered, &ldquo;I am going to boil our last piece
of robe. After we have eaten this there will be
nothing left, and we can then only die.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boy said nothing, but watched her for a little
while, and then stood up and went out of the lodge.
The door had hardly fallen behind him, when the
woman heard a buffalo coughing, and then the
breaking of the crisp snow, as if a heavy weight was
settling on it. In a moment the boy lifted the lodge
door, and came in, and sat down by the fire, and
said to the woman, &ldquo;Go out and bring in some
meat.&rdquo; The woman looked at him, for she was
astonished, but he said nothing, so she went out, and
there in the snow by the side of the lodge was a fat
buffalo cow. Then the woman&rsquo;s heart was glad. She
skinned the cow, and brought some of the meat into
the lodge and cooked it, and they all ate and were
satisfied. The woman was good, so she sent her son
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>201]</a></span>
to the lodges of all her relations, and all her friends,
and told them all to come next morning to her lodge
to a feast, &ldquo;for,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I have plenty of meat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So the next morning all her relations and all her
friends came, so many that they could not all get
into the lodge, but some had to stand outside, and
they ate with her, and she cooked the meat of the
cow for them, and they ate until it was all gone, and
they were satisfied. And after they had done eating,
they lighted their pipes and prayed, saying,
&ldquo;<i>A-ti&acute;-us, we&acute;-t&#365;s kit-tah-we</i>&mdash;Father, you are the
ruler.&rdquo;</p>

<p>While they were smoking the poor boy called
the woman&rsquo;s son to him, and pointed to a high hill
near the camp, and said, &ldquo;<i>Looah, s&#363;ks-kus-sis-pah ti-rah
hah-t&#363;r</i>&mdash;Run hard to the top of that hill,
and tell me what you see.&rdquo; So the boy threw off
his robe, and smoothed back his hair, and started,
and ran as hard as he could over the snow to the top
of the hill. When he got there he shaded his eyes
with his hand, for the sun shone bright on the snow
and blinded him, and he looked east, and west, and
north, and south, but he could see nothing but the
shining white snow on the prairie. After he had
looked all ways, he ran back as hard as he could to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>202]</a></span>
the village. When he came to the lodge, he went to
the poor boy, and said to him, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see anything
but the snow.&rdquo; The poor boy said, &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t look
good. Go again.&rdquo; So the boy started again, and
ran as hard as he could to the hilltop, and when he
got there, panting, he looked all ways, long and carefully,
but still he could see nothing but the snow.
So he turned and ran back to the village, and told
the poor boy again that he saw nothing. The boy
said, &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t look good.&rdquo; Then he took his
bow in his hand, and put his quiver on his back, and
drew his robe up under his arm so that he could run
well, and started, himself, and ran as hard as he
could to the top of the hill, and when he got there
he looked off to the south, and there, as far as he
could see, the plain was black with buffalo struggling
in the deep snow. And he turned to the village,
and signaled them with his robe that buffalo
were in sight. In a few minutes all the Pawnees had
seized their bows and arrows, and were running
toward him, and the women fixed the <i>travois</i>, and
took their knives, and followed. The boy waited on
the hilltop until the warriors came up, and then they
went down to the buffalo, running on the snow.
The buffalo could not get away on account of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>203]</a></span>
deep snow, and the Pawnees made a great killing.
Plenty of fat meat they got, enough to last them
until the summer hunt, and plenty of warm winter
robes. They did not have to move any further, but
stayed right here, killing meat and drying it until
they were all fat and strong again.</p>

<p>And the poor boy became a great doctor in the
tribe, and got rich.</p>

<p>Before this the Pawnees had always had a woman
chief, but when the woman who was chief died, she
named the poor boy as her successor, and the people
made him head chief of the tribe.</p>

<h3>HOW THE DEER LOST HIS GALL.</h3>


<p><span class="dropcap">A</span> LONG time ago, the deer and the antelope
met upon the prairie. At that time both of
them had dew-claws, and both had galls. After they
had talked for a little while, each one of them began
to boast about how fast he could run. Each one,
the deer and the antelope, claimed that he could run
faster than any other animal, and at length they
became very angry in their dispute, and determined
that they would have a race.</p>

<p>They staked their galls on the race, and it was run
on the prairie. The antelope ran the faster, and
won, and took the deer&rsquo;s gall. The deer felt very
badly that he had lost it, and he seemed so miserable
that the antelope felt sorry for him, and to
cheer him up, he took off his dew-claws and gave
them to him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>205]</a></span>
Since that time the deer has had no gall, and the
antelope no dew-claws.</p>


<p class="break"><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;A story somewhat similar to this is current
among the Blackfeet tribes of the northern country.
In this tale the antelope won the deer&rsquo;s gall, as in the
Pawnee story. Then the deer said, &ldquo;You have won,
but that race was not a fair one, for it was over the
prairie alone. We ought to run another race in the
timber to decide which is really the faster.&rdquo; They
agreed to run this second race, and on it they bet
their dew-claws. The deer ran the faster through the
thick timber and over the logs, and beat the antelope,
and took his dew-claws. Since then the antelope has
had no dew-claws, and the deer no gall.</p>

<h3>YELLOW FOX.</h3>


<p><span class="dropcap">A</span> LONG time ago, while the Pawnees were on
their winter hunt, a young boy, <i>Kiwuk-u lah&acute;-kahta</i>
(Yellow Fox), went out alone to hunt, to see
if he could kill a deer. When he left the camp in
the morning, it was warm and pleasant, but in the
middle of the day a great storm of wind and snow
came up, and the flying snow hid everything, and it
grew very cold. By and by the ground was covered
with snow, and the whole look of the prairie was
changed, and the boy became lost, and did not know
where he was, nor what way to go to get to the
camp. All day he walked, but he saw nothing of
the camp, nor of any trail and as it became colder
and colder, he thought that he would surely freeze
to death. He thought that he must die, and that
there was no hope of his ever seeing his people
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>207]</a></span>
again. As he was wandering along, numbed and
stiffened by the cold, and stumbling through the
deep snow, he heard behind him a curious singing
sound, and in time with the singing was the noise
made by some heavy animal, running. The sounds
came nearer, and at last, close by the boy, ran a great
big buffalo bull. And as he ran near the boy, he
sang a song, and as he sang, the sound of his hoofs
on the ground kept time to the measure of the song.
This is what he sang:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>A-ti-us&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ti-wa-ko&nbsp;&nbsp;Ru-ru!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teh-wah-hwa&acute;-ko</i>,<br />
My Father&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;says,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Go on!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He keeps saying,<br />
<br />
<i>Ru-ru-hwa&acute;-hwa&acute;,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wi-ruh-r&#275;</i>.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Keep going on.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will be well.<br /></p>
</div>

<p>The boy&rsquo;s heart became strong when he heard
that the Father had sent the bull, and he followed
him, and the bull led him straight to the camp.</p>

<h3>NOTE.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> notes on the origin, customs and character
of the Pawnees, which follow, have been gathered
during twenty years&rsquo; acquaintance with this
people. They are what they profess to be; not
a history of the people, but a series of notes
bearing on their mode of life in the old wild days,
an attempt to give some clues to their habits of
thought, and thus to indicate the character of the
people. Such notes may be of use to some future
historian who shall have the time and the inclination
to trace out more fully the history of the Pawnees,
and to tell, as it ought to be told, the story of a
people who once were great. I could wish that it
might be my privilege to undertake this congenial
task, but the constantly increasing pressure of other
duties forbids me to hope that I shall be able to do
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>212]</a></span>
so. I feel satisfaction, however, in being able to
record the observations here set down.</p>

<p>In the collection of this material I had for years
the assistance and co&ouml;peration of the late Major
Frank North, who always placed at my disposal
his great store of Pawnee lore. Luther H. North,
his brother, has given me a vast deal of assistance,
and last spring accompanied me to the Pawnee
reservation. Without his aid this book would
never have been written. Mr. John B. Dunbar
has been most kind in reading over the chapter
on the Pawnees, and has aided me with many suggestions,
besides giving me help on certain linguistic
points.</p>

<p>Nothing is said in this volume about the Pawnee
language&mdash;a subject which is sufficiently important
to deserve a volume by itself.</p>

<p>To every intelligent student of North American
aborigines it must be a matter of keen regret that
nothing is known of the language of this people.
That a distinct linguistic stock like the Pawnee
should pass away unrecorded would be a serious
misfortune, and the Bureau of Ethnology of the
Smithsonian Institution ought certainly to take some
steps to preserve a record of the Pawnee language.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>213]</a></span>
Major Frank North was undoubtedly more conversant
with the spoken Pawnee tongue than any
other white man has ever been. Since his death,
there is no one who is so familiar with the language
as Mr. John B. Dunbar, who has devoted much time
to its study, and has made himself acquainted not
only with its vocabulary, but also with its grammar.
Born and reared among the Pawnees, familiar with
them until early manhood, a frequent visitor to
the tribe in later years, he is well fitted by interest
and association to undertake the task of recording in
permanent form the unwritten speech of this people.
Add to this a long training as a student of language
and history and a keen logical mind, and we have
in Mr. Dunbar the man more than all others best
fitted to undertake this difficult but most delightful
task. The Director of the Bureau of Ethnology
could not easily perform a greater service to aboriginal
linguistics than to intrust to Mr. Dunbar the
labor of preparing an extended work on the Pawnee
language.</p>

<h3><a name="the_pawnees" id="the_pawnees"></a>THE PAWNEES.</h3>


<h4><a name="notes_1_1" id="notes_1_1"></a>I. RELATIONSHIPS.</h4>

<p><span class="dropcap">U</span>NTIL within a few years the home of the
Pawnees was in southern Nebraska and
northern Kansas. This group of tribes may be
called the main stock of the family; from them it
took its name; they are its best and longest known
members. In the earlier accounts of this people,
the Pawnee Picts or Wichitas are often confounded
with their more northern relatives.</p>

<p>The Pawnees proper consisted at one time of three
bands or tribes, federated under a single head chief.
These bands, in the order of their importance, were:
The Chau-i, the Kit-ke-hahk&acute;-i and the Pita-hau-erat.
To these three was subsequently added&mdash;after the
northern migration of the tribes, and their settlement
in northern Kansas and Nebraska, but probably
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>216]</a></span>
long anterior to the advent of the whites, and by
conquest&mdash;the large, powerful and intelligent allied
tribe, known as the Skidi or Pawnee Loups. These
four have always been known in the writings of the
earlier explorers in the West as respectively the
Grand, the Republican, the Tapage and the Wolf
Pawnees, and they constituted the Pawnee Nation.</p>

<p>The three tribes first named have always been
together, and their Pawnee names, according to
Major North, denoted the relative situations of the
three villages. Thus Kit-ke-hahk&acute;-i means &ldquo;on a
hill;&rdquo; Chau-i, &ldquo;in the middle;&rdquo; Pita-hau-erat, &ldquo;down
the stream,&rdquo; or east; and in the olden times these
were the relative positions of the different villages
when the three bands were camping together. The
Kit-ke-hahk&acute;-i village was always the westernmost of
the three, the Chau-i were next to them, and the
Pita-hau-erat were furthest east. After the incorporation
of the Skidi with the Pawnees, the village
of that tribe was always placed furthest to the west,
and it was spoken of as the Upper Village, while
the other bands were termed the Lower Village
Tribes.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 364px;">
<a name="good_chief" id="good_chief"></a>

alt="Refer to caption" />
</div>

<p class="caption">GOOD CHIEF&mdash;KIT-KE-HAHK&acute;-I.</p>

<p>Of the three original bands, the Chau-i has always
been first in importance, and the head chief has been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217"><!-- original location of Good Chief illustration --></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>218]</a></span>
chosen from it. The Kit-ke-hahk&acute;-i band in numbers,
importance and intelligence appear to rank
about with the Chau-i, while, on the other hand, the
Pita-hau-erat are regarded as less intelligent, responsible
and worthy than the other bands.</p>

<p>The Skidi are usually looked upon as more intelligent
than the Pawnees, and also as fiercer in their
nature, and as making better soldiers. The Skidi
traditions, though such testimony, of course, is not
of much value, speak rather contemptuously of the
prowess of the other bands in war, and the superiority
of the Skidi is grudgingly acknowledged by the
others. This is contrary to the view held by Mr. J.&nbsp;B.
Dunbar, who speaks of the Skidi as more intelligent
than the other bands, but as not being so good
as warriors.</p>

<p>Besides this main group of tribes, the members of
the Pawnee family, as given by Mr. Dunbar, are the
Arickaras, known also as the Arickarees, Ricarees or
Rees, the Caddos, the Huecos or Wacos, the
Keechies, the Tawaconies, and the Wichitas or Pawnee
Picts. To these may be added with some confidence
the Tonkaways and the Lipans. The Caddos,
Huecos, Keechies and Tawaconies are regarded
by the Pawnees as closely connected with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>219]</a></span>
Wichitas. They had but one name, <i>Kiri-ku&acute;ruks</i>, for
all these tribes, and knew no distinction between
them. There is no doubt that the Arickaras were
recently&mdash;perhaps within a century&mdash;either a band
of the Skidi tribe, or at least allied to them as
closely as the Chau-i have always been to the Kit-ke-hahk&acute;-i
and the Pita-hau-erat. The relationship of
the Tonkaways and the Lipans has only recently
been discovered, and has come to light through the
removal of the Pawnees from their home in Nebraska
to their present reservation in the Indian Territory.</p>

<p>In a note appended to his article on the Pawnees,
published in the <i>Magazine of American History</i> for
November, 1880, Mr. Dunbar says, &ldquo;A friend, who
has had much experience with the Indians of the
Southwest, informs me that he is inclined to believe
that the Lipans of Mexico are of Pawnee stock.
They have, in times past, exchanged frequent hospitalities
with the Wichitas, or Pawnee Picts, and the
two understand each other&rsquo;s dialects readily. The
name Lipans he explains as <i>li&rsquo;panis</i>, that is, <em>the</em>
Pawnees.&rdquo; While this suggestion is very interesting,
so far as it goes, it scarcely furnishes sufficient
ground on which to base a genetic connection of the
Lipans with the Pawnee family. I have recently
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>220]</a></span>
secured additional and more satisfactory evidence of
such a connection.</p>

<p>It is generally believed by the Pawnees, especially
by those who are most intelligent, and have had
most intercourse with the southern tribes, that the
Lipans are allied to them, and that this relationship
is traceable through the Wichitas and the Tonkaways.
The evidence consists of (1) statements by the
Wichitas and Tonkaways, (2) an alleged similarity of
language and personal names, and (3) a similarity in
the songs of the tribes. A Pawnee Indian, who has
lived for seven seasons with the Wichitas, gave me
the following story which he had gathered from that
people. They say that long ago they did not know
the Tonkaways, but that when the tribes met they
found that they could understand each other&rsquo;s speech.
Their languages were not the same, but they were
not more unlike than were the tongues spoken by the
Skidi and the three other Pawnee bands long ago;
in other words, they were dialects of the same
language. After that meeting, the Tonkaways and
the Wichitas lived together for a time. But the
Tonkaways had bad ways. They would eat human
flesh. When they could find a Wichita boy out away
from the camp, they would capture him, and strangle
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>221]</a></span>
and eat him. Sometimes they would kill a man of
the Wichitas, if they could catch him away off on the
prairie. Therefore the Wichitas drove the Tonkaways
off south, and soon afterward moved up across
the Arkansas River, and into southern Kansas.
Since then the Wichitas and the Tonkaways have
never lived together. A Tonkaway chief named
Charlie told Ralph J. Weeks, an educated Pawnee,
&ldquo;I have heard that my people are Pawnees, but that
we separated long ago.&rdquo; I am informed that the
personal names of the Tonkaways are the same as
those of the Pawnees, and are readily comprehended
by the latter. Ralph Weeks, while in a Tonkaway
lodge, heard a man call out to a girl, addressing her
as <i>Tsi-sah-ru-rah-ka&acute;-ri-ku</i>, which means &ldquo;Woman
Chief&rsquo;s House.&rdquo; Ralph inquired about this name,
and found that it was the same in sound as Pawnee,
and had the same meaning. The Tonkaways say
that some of the Pawnee words are the same as
those used by their relations to the south, the Lipans
and others. The songs of the Tonkaways are the
same as those of the Pawnees, and the latter at once
recognize them. The old songs of the Lipans are
the same as those of the Pawnees, according to both
Pawnee and Tonkaway testimony. Finally, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>222]</a></span>
Tonkaways and Lipans claim close relationship.
They speak different dialects of the same language.</p>

<p>The Pawnees, however, say that they never knew
of the existence of the Tonkaways until they came
down into the Indian Territory, and, of course, never
met them until after that time. Neither did they
know the Caddos. As the Pawnees knew nothing of
the Caddos and Tonkaways, so the Wichitas knew
nothing of the Arickaras until recently, and were
greatly surprised to learn that far to the north there
was another tribe which spoke their language.</p>

<p>The Wichitas claim that they and the Caddos are
one people. Their languages are said to differ
somewhat, but only dialectically.</p>

<p>The southern members of the Pawnee family
appear always to have lived on excellent terms with
the other wild tribes which inhabited their country.
They were allies of the Kiowas, Comanches, and
Cheyennes, tribes with which the northern Pawnees
were long at war.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>223]</a></span></p>

<h4><a name="notes_1_2" id="notes_1_2"></a>II. ORIGIN AND MIGRATIONS.</h4>

<p>The Pawnees came from the south. All the information
bearing on their origin, which has as yet
been secured, points to the conclusion that the
primitive home of this family was in the south.</p>

<p>Although Mr. Dunbar has carefully traced out the
later history of several of the members of this group,
his researches carry us back scarcely further than the
beginning of the present century, and we have no
actual knowledge of the origin and early history of
the Pawnees. Except the Arickaras, none of the
tribes belonging to this family have ever dwelt much
north of the Platte River, and in this we have an
indication of their southern origin. The traditions
of the tribe confirm this suggestion, and Mr. Dunbar
has given other reasons, derived from his study of
this people, which abundantly justify us in regarding
them as migrants from the south.</p>

<p>There are still current among the Pawnees two
traditions as to the region from which they came, but
both of these are vague, and so lacking in detail as
to be of little value except as suggestions which
need confirmation before being accepted as having
any solid basis of fact. The first of these traditions,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>224]</a></span>
now half forgotten, is known only to the very oldest
men. It is to the effect that long ago they came
from the far southwest, where they used to live in
stone houses. This might point to an original home
for the Pawnees in Old Mexico, and even suggests a
possible connection with the so-called Pueblo tribes,
who still live in houses made of stone, and entered
from above.</p>

<p>Secret Pipe Chief, a very old Chau-i, the High
Priest of the tribe, gave me the history of their wanderings
in these words: &ldquo;Long ago,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;very
far back, all of one color were together, but something
mysterious happened so that they came to
speak different languages. They were all together,
and determined that they would separate into different
parties to go and get sinew. They could not
all go in company, there were too many of them.
They were so numerous that when they traveled, the
rocks where their lodge poles dragged were worn
into deep grooves. Then they were far off in the
southwest, and came from beyond two ranges of
mountains. When they scattered out, each party
became a tribe. At that time the Pawnees and the
Wichitas were together. We made that journey, and
went so far east that at last we came to the Missouri
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>225]</a></span>
River, and stopped there for a time. When the
season came round, we made out of the shoulder
blade of a buffalo an implement to cultivate the
ground. There we made our fields.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Another very old man, Bear Chief, a Skidi, said,
&ldquo;Long ago we were far in the southwest, away
beyond the Rio Grande. We came north, and
settled near the Wichita Mountains. One summer
there we planted our corn. So we came from the
south. After we left the Wichita Mountains, that
summer we came north as far as the Arkansas River,
and made our fields, and raised corn. Afterward we
went to the Mississippi River where the Missouri
runs into it. My father was born while we lived on
the Mississippi.&rdquo; As Bear Chief must be nearly or
quite eighty years old, it would seem likely that the
Skidi, or some village of that tribe, may have been
established on the Mississippi one hundred years
ago, but this was not a permanent location.</p>

<p>The second of these traditions tells of a migration
from the southeast. It states that the tribe originally
came from somewhere in the southeast, that is
from what is now Missouri or Arkansas. They
started north after sinew&mdash;to hunt buffalo&mdash;and followed
up the game, until they reached the northern
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>226]</a></span>
country&mdash;the region of the Republican and the
Platte rivers. They found this a pleasant country,
abounding in game, and they liked it, and remained
there. The Wichitas accompanied them part way on
their journey, but turned aside when they had
reached southern Kansas, and went south again.</p>

<p>All the traditions agree that up to the time of the
journey which brought the Pawnees to their homes
on the Solomon, Republican, Platte and Loup rivers,
the Wichitas were considered a part of the Pawnee
tribe. They agree also that after this separation,
the two divisions of the tribe lost sight of each other
for a very long time, and that each was entirely
ignorant as to what had become of the other. We
know that for a long time they were at war, and the
difference of the dialects spoken by these two
divisions of the family shows that the period of
separation was a long one.</p>

<p>The tradition of the migration of the Pawnees
from the southwest is evidently much older than the
one which tells of their coming from the southeast.
Most of the younger men know the latter; but for
the account of the journey over the mountains from
the southwest and across the Rio Grande, it is necessary
to go to the very old men. It is quite
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>227]</a></span>
possible that both stories are founded on fact; and, if
this is the case, the migration from the southeast
may have taken place only a few generations ago.
Such a supposition would in part explain its general
currency at the present time.</p>

<p>In the existing state of our knowledge of this
people, we have no facts to go on, nothing in the
nature of evidence as to their early history, and we
can only speculate as to the probabilities in regard
to their wanderings. It may be conjectured that
the Pawnees came from somewhere in Old Mexico,
and, either as a number of related tribes, or as a
single tribe made up of different bands, they crossed
the mountains and the Rio Grande in a body, and
wandered eastward across what is now Texas. From
this body it seems probable that the ancestors of the
Lipans and the Tonkaways were the first to separate
themselves. The main tribe perhaps gradually drifted
further and further to the east until it had crossed
Texas and reached northwestern Louisiana, and perhaps
even the neighborhood of the Mississippi River.
During this long journey, which must have occupied
many years&mdash;perhaps many generations&mdash;we may
imagine that the Huecos and possibly the Keechies
dropped behind, and remained on the plains.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>228]</a></span>
How long the Pawnees sojourned in Louisiana
no one can say. They now found themselves in a
country, which in climate, productions, and topography,
differed widely from anything they had before
known. Up to this time, these people had always
inhabited the high, dry tablelands of Mexico, or the
almost equally arid plains of Texas, and now they
had come to a country having a heavy rainfall,
abounding in swamps, and overgrown with deciduous
timber. The traditions of both Skidi and Pawnees
speak of a time when they lived in a country
where grows the cane which the white men use for
fishing poles. We may imagine that this forest country
was a barrier to their further progress eastward,
and that it turned their steps in a new direction.</p>

<p>When the Pawnees left Louisiana, the Caddos certainly,
and perhaps the Keechies and the Tawaconies,
were left behind, and for a very long time lived in
and near what is now Caddo Parish, Louisiana, where
they were at the time of the Louisiana Purchase.
Geographical names in this region indicate that their
residence there was a long one, and Caddo Lake,
Caddo Fork, Caddo Gap and a town named Keatchie,
still bear testimony of the former occupants of
the soil. From there the Caddos moved up to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>229]</a></span>
Brazos River in Texas. They have always kept up
a close intimacy with the Wichitas.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was during the sojourn of the Pawnees
on the western borders of Louisiana and Arkansas,
though it may have been much earlier, that the
Skidi and the Arickaras, either as a single tribe, or
as already divided into two separate bands, left the
Pawnees and moved north and northwest. There
appears to be reason for supposing that for a while
this section of the tribe lived on the Red River, the
Canadian and the Arkansas, and it is quite certain
that sometimes they went as far east as the banks of
the Mississippi near where St. Louis now is; but
their permanent home, since they have been known
to the whites, was on the Platte and the Loup rivers
in Nebraska.</p>

<p>The Pawnees with the Wichitas moved northwest
into what is now the Indian Territory and southern
Kansas, where they separated, the latter turning off
to the south, and living at various times on the Canadian
and Red rivers and near the Wichita Mountains,
while the Pawnees proper slowly continued
their march northward and westward, residing for a
time on the Arkansas and Solomon, the Republican
and Platte rivers. Here they again met the Skidi.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>230]</a></span>
It is impossible to conjecture when this settlement
in the northern country took place, but it was certainly
long ago. Mr. Dunbar has pointed out that
&ldquo;<i>O-k&#365;t-ut</i> and <i>oku&acute;-kat&acute;</i> signify strictly above and
below (of a stream) respectively. Now their villages
have usually been situated upon the banks of the
Platte, the general course of which is from west to
east. Hence each of these words has acquired a
new meaning, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>, west and east.&rdquo; In the same way
<i>P&#365;k-t&#301;s&acute;-tu</i>&mdash;toward the Omahas, has come to mean
north; and <i>Ki&acute;ri-ku&acute;ruks-tu</i>&mdash;toward the Wichitas, to
mean south. The coining of such words points to a
long sojourn by the Pawnees in the region of the
Platte. It is interesting to note that the Omahas
have never in historic times lived north of the Pawnees,
but always east of them, though we know that
long ago they did live to the north.</p>

<p>These remarks on the movements of the Pawnees
are, to be sure, very largely speculative, but speculation
guided by the hints gathered from conversations
with the older men. It is a surmise as to what
may have been the wanderings of these people. If
it were possible to talk with all the different tribes
of the family, something more definite might be
reached, but at this late day this seems hopeless. A
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>231]</a></span>
study of the Lipans, and an investigation of their
relationships with other southwestern tribes, might
furnish us clues of the utmost importance in tracing
the origin of the Pawnee family.</p>


<h4><a name="notes_1_3" id="notes_1_3"></a>III. THE SKIDI.</h4>

<p>Ranking high among the Pawnee bands, for their
intelligence, energy and courage, stand the Skidi.
Their past history is obscure, and we know little
about it beyond the fact that it was different from
that of the other bands. Although the relationship
between them is perfectly well established, still both
Pawnee and Skidi traditions agree that the two
tribes were originally distinct, and that their first
meeting took place long ago, but after the migration
of the Pawnees to the northern country. We know,
too, that the Arickaras were close neighbors and near
relatives of the Skidi, and it is probable that they
constituted a band, village, or division of that tribe.</p>

<p>It is believed by those who should be well informed,
that the northward migration of the Rees
took place not more than a century ago. One tradition
of the separation runs in this way: The Skidi
started out on a hunt, a part going ahead and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>232]</a></span>
others following later. The first party were killing
buffalo, when they were attacked by a large war
party of Sioux. These got between the two parties
of the Skidi, driving one of them back to the village,
while the other retreated northward. This retreat
continued until they had been driven some distance
up the Missouri River, where their enemies left them.
They remained there through the winter, and planted
their corn in the spring, nor did they apparently for
some time make any attempt to rejoin their tribe.
After some years, however, the two bands came
together on the Loup, and for a time lived together.
The Rees even went further south, to the neighborhood
of the Wichita Mountains, where the Pawnees
at that time were living, but soon afterward they
went north again, and rejoined the Skidi on the
Loup, and lived near them there, and on the Platte
near Scott&rsquo;s Bluffs. It was not long, however, before
a disagreement arose between the Rees and the
Skidi, and the Rees again moved off north. It is
probable that this quarrel may have originated in
the fact that the Rees wished to make war on the
whites, but there is some reason to believe that there
was also jealousy about the head chieftainship of the
two bands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>233]</a></span>
The testimony of men still living indicates that
about one hundred years ago some of the Skidi lived
on the Mississippi River, near the present site of St.
Louis, and it is said that it was only the coming in
of the white settlers in considerable numbers that
caused them to move further westward. I am inclined
to regard this location as only a temporary
one, and to believe that their real home, prior to this,
had been to the west, on the Platte and Loup rivers.</p>

<p>It is, of course, impossible to fix, even approximately,
the time when the Pawnees and the Skidi
came together, but it probably was soon after the
Pawnees had settled on the Republican in their
northward migration. It is said that their first
meeting was friendly, and that they made a treaty,
and smoked together. But no peace between two
such warlike tribes could last very long, and there
were frequent collisions and disagreements. There
was a sharp rivalry between the Chau-i and the
Skidi, and their disputes finally culminated in an unprovoked
attack by the Skidi upon some Pawnees,
while they were hunting buffalo, in which about one
hundred of the latter were killed. The Pawnees
made ready to avenge this injury, and marshaled all
their forces. They made a night march to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>234]</a></span>
vicinity of the Skidi village, which is said to have
been on the north side of the Loup, distant from
their own only about twenty miles, and just at daylight
sent out about one hundred warriors, all
mounted on dark colored horses, to decoy the Skidi
from the village. These men, lying down on their
horses, and covering themselves with their robes,
represented buffalo, and rode over the hill in sight
of the Skidi village. The ruse was successful. The
Skidi at once started out to kill the buffalo, leaving
their village unprotected. The disguised warriors
fled, leading the Skidi further away, while the Pawnees
who were in reserve rushed into the defenseless
village, and captured it, almost without striking a
blow. They took all the inhabitants back with them
to their own village. The Skidi were forced to sue
for peace; and for their breach of faith were heavily
fined by the victorious Pawnees. They were incorporated
into the tribe, and since that time have lived
as a part of the Pawnee nation. This event was
probably the culminating point of a series of petty
fights and skirmishes, which must have been annoying
to the Pawnees. This fighting went on within
the memory of men now living, though there are but
few who are old enough to remember it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>235]</a></span>
Curly Chief, who is about 65 years old, can
remember a man who took part in these wars, and
whose name was &ldquo;The-Skidi-wounded-him-in-the-leg.&rdquo;
Bear Chief, a very old and decrepit Skidi,
and Secret Pipe Chief, an old Chau-i, have both
told me that they can remember one or more fights
between the Skidi and the other bands.</p>

<p>A rather interesting evidence of the feeling once
existing between the Skidi and the other bands,
and even now surviving among some of the oldest
men, is the statement by Bear Chief that the three
other bands were known as &ldquo;Big Shields,&rdquo; the implication
being that as they hid themselves behind
these big shields they were not so brave as those
who used smaller ones. The existence of such a
feeling at the present day indicates that the final
conquest of the Skidi and their incorporation into
the Pawnee tribe took place not very long ago.</p>

<p>Mr. Dunbar sums up the traditions of the meeting
of the tribes, their wars and subsequent union, in
the following language: &ldquo;The historic basis of this
may be somewhat as follows: In the migration of
the Pawnees from the south, the Skidi preceded the
other bands perhaps by nearly a century. With
them were the Arickaras. These two bands
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>236]</a></span>
together possessed themselves of the region of the
Loup. When the other bands arrived they were
regarded as intruders, and hence arose open hostilities.
The result of the struggle was that the two
bands were forced to admit the new comers, and aid
in reducing the surrounding territory. Subsequently
the Arickaras seem to have wandered, or more probably,
to have been driven from the confederacy, and
to have passed up the Missouri. Later the Skidi, in
consequence of some real or fancied provocation,
attempted to retrieve their losses, but were sorely
punished, and henceforth obliged to content themselves
with a subordinate position in the tribe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It is said that in the olden time the Skidi were
very powerful. The tribe was made up of four
bands or villages, each of which numbered 5,000
people, or 20,000 for the whole tribe. This estimate,
which is founded merely on the statements of old
men now living, is probably excessive. There is no
doubt, however, that they were a large and powerful
tribe, while their warlike habits and fierce natures
caused them to be feared and hated by all their
neighbors.</p>

<p>The four divisions of the Skidi tribe exist now
only in name, and the origin of these names is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>237]</a></span>
almost forgotten. As the result of much effort and
inquiry, I have secured the following list:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center"><i>Names of the Skidi Bands.</i></p>

<p>1. <i>Tuhk-pah-huks-taht</i>&mdash;Pumpkin vine village.
This name is said to have come from the fact that
once, after planting time, this band went off on the
summer hunt, and while they were away, the pumpkin
vines grew so luxuriantly that they climbed up
over the lodges, covering and hiding them.</p>

<p>2. <i>Skidi rah&acute;ru</i>&mdash;Wolves in the pools (of water).
The name originated in this way: Long ago one
band of the Skidi were camped on the Loup River.
It was winter, and the buffalo came to them in great
numbers. They killed many and prepared great
quantities of dried meat. The buffalo kept coming,
and at length they had so much meat that they had
room for no more. When they could no longer
store dried meat, they stopped taking the flesh of
the buffalo and took only the hides. The buffalo
continued to come and to cross the river just below
the camp, and the men on foot would chase the
buffalo on the ice, where the great animals would
slip and sprawl, so that the Skidi could run up
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>238]</a></span>
close, and stab them. They would skin them there
and leave the carcasses on the ice. From far and
near great numbers of wolves gathered to feed on
the carcasses, and as it was toward spring, and the
weather was growing milder, the ice began to melt
on top, and little pools of water stood on it. About
this time, there came to this village a Skidi from
another band who were half starving, for they could
find no buffalo at all. When the man saw that this
village had so much meat, he wondered at the
plenty, and asked how it was. They took him out
from the village down to where the dead buffalo lay
on the ice, and pointed them out to him, and he saw
the wolves standing in the water and feeding on the
carcasses. Then they took him back to the village,
gave him all the dried meat he could carry, and sent
him away to his home, heavily loaded. When he
reached his own village he told the people there
how those in the other camp had plenty, and when
they asked him where it was, he told them, and said
that it was <i>Skidi rah&acute;ru</i>&mdash;where the wolves stand in
the pools of water.</p>

<p>3. <i>Tuh-wa-hok&acute;-a-sha</i>&mdash;Village on a ridge. <i>Tuh</i>&mdash;village,
<i>wa</i>&mdash;the central roach on the head of a
man whose hair has been shaved on both sides,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>239]</a></span>
<i>hok&acute;-a-sha</i>&mdash;curving over. This village was on a ridge,
reaching over on both sides of it.</p>

<p>4. <i>Tu-hi&acute;ts-pi-yet</i>&mdash;Village on a point or peninsula.
<i>Tuh</i>&mdash;village, camp, or band; <i>hits-pi-yu</i>&mdash;a point.</p>
</div>

<p>There are yet to be seen on the Loup Fork, in
Nebraska, innumerable remains of Skidi villages,
some of which are very ancient.</p>


<h4><a name="notes_1_4" id="notes_1_4"></a>IV. NAME AND EMBLEM.</h4>

<p>It is probable that the name Pawnee, as Mr. Dunbar
has remarked, is an abbreviated form of the
word <i>pa-ri&acute;-ki</i>, which means a horn, and referred to
the peculiar erect scalp lock which may once have
been worn by this tribe. As Mr. Dunbar says, the
name probably once embraced the Pawnee Picts or
Wichitas, among whom this fashion of wearing the
hair seems to have persisted long after it had been
abandoned by the Pawnees. The same writer gives
the name Arickara as from &ldquo;<i>&#365;r&acute;-ik-i</i>, a horn; with a
verbal or plural suffix, being thus simply a later and
exact equivalent of <i>Pa&acute;-ni</i> itself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The name Pawnee Picts, so commonly applied to
the Wichitas, appears to mean Pawnee Picked, or
tattooed Pawnees; and refers to the markings upon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>240]</a></span>
the faces and breasts of these people, which are
picked in with a sharp instrument. The northern
Indians speak of the Pawnees as <i>Pa-na&acute;-na</i>, while
the southern tribes call them <i>Pi-ta&acute;-da</i>, and the Dakotas
call the Arickaras <i>Pa-da&acute;-ni</i>. All these appear
to be merely attempts to reproduce the name by
which the Pawnees call themselves, <i>Pa&acute;-ni</i>.</p>

<p>The English names of the four bands of the Pawnees
are, as has been already stated, for the Skidi,
the Wolf; for the Chau-i, the Grand; for the Kit-ke-hahk&acute;-i,
the Republican, and for the Pita-hau-erat, the
Tapaje, Pawnees.</p>

<p>An old French trader, who has known these
people for many years, states that the Skidi are
called Wolf Pawnees from the river Loup, on which
they lived; that Grand is an abbreviation for <i>Grand-pas</i>,
because the Chau-i were mostly tall men and
took long steps; that the Kit-ke-hahk&acute;-i were called
Republican from the river of that name, and the
Pita-hau-erat <i>Tapaje</i> (Fr. noisy), because they are
noisy and restless, and are continually moving about
from place to place. This explanation of these English
names is not altogether satisfactory. Mr. Dunbar
informs me that he believes that the Chau-i were
called Grand from the appellation given them by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>241]</a></span>
Spaniards, who called them <i>Los Grandes</i>, referring
to their physical stature.</p>

<p>In the chapter on the Skidi the names of the four
bands of that tribe have been given, and their origin
and derivation. The other tribes were divided into
bands, or gentes, but these divisions have almost
been forgotten. Of the Chau-i there is now said to
be only one band; of the Kit-ke-hahk&acute;-i three; the
Great Kit-ke-hahk&acute;-i, Little Kit-ke-hahk&acute;-i, and Blackhead
Kit-ke-hahk&acute;-i; while of the Pita-hau-erat there
were two bands, the Pita-hau-erat proper and the
Ka-wa-ra&acute;-kish. This last-named division appears to
have had some customs peculiar to itself, and quite
different from anything known to the other Pawnees.</p>

<p>The Pawnees call the Wichitas and the other related
southern tribes <i>Kiri-kur&acute;uks</i>&mdash;Bear&rsquo;s-eyes. The
reason for this appellation is obscure. The only explanation
of it that I have been able to obtain, is that
when the Pawnees first saw the Wichitas they
thought they had eyes like a bear. As Mr. Dunbar
has suggested to me, the allusion may have been to
the ring sometimes painted or tattooed about the
eyes of the Wichitas.</p>

<p>It is generally supposed that an Indian receives
his personal name from some peculiarly memorable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>242]</a></span>
act that he has performed, or from some incident
that has happened to him. This is not now commonly
the case in the tribes with which I am best
acquainted. Personal names formerly originated in
this way among the Indians, but at the present day
I question much if they are often given for such
reasons. Most of the names borne by the warriors
have been long known in the tribe, and I believe the
coining of new names to fit a special set of circumstances
to be now quite unusual. Children were
named soon after they were born, and retained their
childish names until well grown. <i>Ta&acute;-ka</i>&mdash;white,
was a common boy&rsquo;s name, as was <i>Ka-tit</i>&mdash;black;
<i>Ki-ri&acute;ki</i>&mdash;bright eyes, was often given to little girls.
Nicknames referring to personal peculiarities were
common.</p>

<p>Here is a list which will give some notion of the
general character of the Pawnee names: Lucky
Hawk, Good Fox, Turn-your-robe-hair-out, Chief of
Men, Pipe Chief, Lone Chief, Leader, Brave Chief,
Leading Fox, Still Hawk, Hunting Chief, Yellow
Fox, Charging-the-camp, Angry Chief, Little Warrior,
Good Bear, Eagle Chief, Sun Chief, White
Horse, He-gives-away-many-horses-and-others-ride-them,
Riding-up, Good Sky, Walking Bear, Proud
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>243]</a></span>
Eagle, Seven Stars, Sitting Bull, Big Mountain,
Fancy Horse, Fox Chief, Good Sun, Curly Hair,
Blue Hawk, Mad Wolf, White Elk, Young Hawk,
War Chief, Good Chief, Curly Chief, Sitting Eagle,
Running Eagle, Mad Bear, Walking Sun, See-the-eagle-flying,
etc.</p>

<p>Mr. Dunbar states that &ldquo;the tribal mark of the
Pawnees in their pictographic or historic painting
was the scalp lock dressed to stand nearly erect, or
curving slightly backward something like a horn.&rdquo; I
have never met a Pawnee who knew of this manner
of dressing the hair in his own tribe, but all unite in
stating that the Wichitas used to wear the lock in
this manner. If this is the case, no doubt in ancient
times it was common to the Pawnees as well, but
with them it has become obsolete, and is now
forgotten.</p>

<p>In books the sign for &ldquo;Pawnee&rdquo; is sometimes
given as the forefinger of the right hand held at the
back of the crown of the head, and pointing upward
to represent this erect scalp lock, but I conceive
that this sign is really that of the Pawnee Picts or
Wichitas, who have been so constantly confused
with the true or northern Pawnees.</p>

employed among Indians in the West is that for
&ldquo;wolf,&rdquo; which is the name under which the Pawnees
are, or at least were formerly, known to most other
tribes. This sign is made in two ways, (1) by holding
the two hands, palm forward, the first and middle
fingers extended close together upward and a little
forward, thumb and other fingers closed, close to
the head, about opposite the temple; (2) the right
hand alone may be held palm forward at the height
of, and just in front of, the shoulder, the first and
middle fingers extended, separated and pointing
upward, the thumb and others closed; the hand is
then moved forward and downward from the wrist,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>245]</a></span>
so that the extended fingers point almost to the
front. Both these signs represent the pricked ears
of a wolf, and, so far as my experience goes, are
universally understood to mean &ldquo;Pawnee.&rdquo; The
one last described is now much the more common of
the two. The first of these signs is shown in the
frontispiece, which is copied from an engraving in
the First Annual Report of the Bureau of Ethnology.</p>

<p>The Pawnees have always been called by their
neighbors to the south &ldquo;Wolves.&rdquo; It has been suggested
that this term was applied to them by their
enemies in contempt, but there seems no reason for
believing this to have been the case, since it may be
doubted that an Indian feels contempt for a wolf
any more than he does for a fox, a rabbit, or an elk.</p>

<p>An Indian going into an enemy&rsquo;s country is often
called a wolf, and the sign for &ldquo;a scout&rdquo; is made up
of the signs &ldquo;wolf&rdquo; and &ldquo;look.&rdquo; The Pawnees
were most adroit scouts, warriors and stealers of
horses; and it seems perfectly natural that they
should have received from the neighboring tribes,
who had such frequent evidences of their skill as
scouts and horse takers, the appellation Wolf. The
Pawnees themselves believe that the term was
applied to them because of their great endurance,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>246]</a></span>
as well as of their skill in imitating wolves so as to
escape detection by the enemy either by day or
night. The Cheyennes, Wichitas and Comanches all
testify that they call the Pawnees Wolves because
they prowl like wolves; because, too, they have the
endurance of wolves, and can travel all day, and
dance all night, and can make long journeys, living
on the carcasses they find on their way, or on no
food at all.</p>

<p>The Pawnees, when they went on the warpath,
were always prepared to simulate wolves. This was
one of their regular practices, and this no doubt was
one reason for their remarkable success in taking
horses, for it enabled them to escape observation
and to reconnoitre at close quarters without danger
of discovery. Wolves on the prairie were too common
to excite remark, and at night they would approach
close to the Indian camps, and often venture
into them. The Pawnee who was disguised as a
wolf could trot up close to the village of his enemy,
see where the horses were tied, and perhaps even
hear what was being said, and lay his plans accordingly.
The Pawnee starting off on the warpath
usually carried a robe made of wolf skins, or in
later times a white blanket or a white sheet; and, at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>247]</a></span>
night, wrapping himself in this, and getting down on
his hands and knees, he walked or trotted here and
there like a wolf, having thus transformed himself
into a common object of the landscape. This disguise
was employed by day as well. To escape observation
when traveling in daylight, the Pawnee
war party always chose the ravines and lower ground
to march in. Sometimes, especially in a country
where there was danger of coming unexpectedly on
the enemy, it was important that a reconnoissance
should be made from some commanding point. A
man walking up to the top of a hill might be seen,
and recognized as a suspicious object, a long way
off, but no one would look a second time at a wolf.
While the party remained hidden in some ravine or
hollow, therefore, the man who was to ascend the
hill would put his white robe over him and gallop
to the top on all fours, and would sit there on his
haunches looking all over the country, and any one
at a distance who saw him, would take him for a
wolf. It was acknowledged on all hands that the
Pawnees could imitate wolves best. In one of the
stories already given, an instance is mentioned in
which two Pawnees in the United States service
made use of this device to recover captured animals.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>248]</a></span>
The name &ldquo;Wolf,&rdquo; as given to the Pawnees, is
probably merely a translation of the word <i>Skiri&acute;ki</i>,
meaning wolf, from which the name of the Skidi
band may be supposed to be derived. Mr. Dunbar
says: &ldquo;The emblem probably originated from the
Skidi band. They being in advance of the other
bands in the northern migration, became known to
the tribes about them as wolves; and as the other
bands arrived the sign was naturally made to include
them also, and in this enlarged use was at length accepted
by the Pawnees themselves.&rdquo;</p>

<h3><a name="pawnee_customs" id="pawnee_customs"></a>PAWNEE CUSTOMS.</h3>


<h4><a name="notes_2_1" id="notes_2_1"></a>I. EARLY DAYS.</h4>

<p><span class="dropcap">P</span>AWNEE history goes back to a time when the
tribe knew nothing of horses. In those early
days they went on foot, and depended for animal
food on their bows and arrows. At that time their
bows did not differ from those recently in use, but
the heads of their arrows were made of stone, and
their knives were of flint. With this simple equipment
they set out on the hunt.</p>

<p>Choosing a still day, they would surround a small
bunch of buffalo, stretching out in a long line whose
extremities would gradually draw together, as the
hunters, perhaps disguised as wolves, stole from hill
to hill, around the unconscious prey. When the
circle was complete, some one man would shout and
startle the buffalo, and then as they turned to run,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>250]</a></span>
another man would show himself before them, and
call out, and turn them, and whichever way they ran,
some one would appear before them, and turn them
back. The buffalo, becoming each moment more
frightened, would run now this way, now that, and
gradually the Pawnees would close in on them, but
would still keep the buffalo from breaking through
the line by yelling, and by tossing their robes in the
air. As the prey became more and more terror-stricken
and confused, they would run here and
there, and round and round within the ring of men;
and as they grew more tired, the men would close in
on them still more, and first one, and then another,
would shoot an arrow, until at last the arrows were
flying fast, and some of the great beasts were down,
and others were staggering along with the blood
pouring from their mouths; and soon the buffalo
were so worn out that they could run no longer, and
it was an easy matter for the Indians to dispatch
them. Even those which were only slightly wounded
were secured, for it is said that when the animals
were hit by the arrows, even if it were only in the
leg, they would soon swell up and die. This statement
refers to a belief, which I find quite widespread
among plains Indians, that the ancient stone arrow
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>251]</a></span>
heads were peculiarly deadly, and possessed this
property, that even a slight touch with them made a
wound which was likely to be fatal. The Blackfeet
Indians have often told me the same thing about the
stone arrow heads which they used in early times.</p>

<p>Game, which inhabited the underbrush or the
forest, was captured by a method similar to that
employed to secure the buffalo. If the Pawnees
discovered that deer or elk were in a piece of timber,
they would surround it, and then alarm the game,
and keep them from breaking through the line of
men. The animals, frightened and confused, would
run round and round in a circle until exhausted,
when the Pawnees would close in, and kill them with
their arrows.</p>

<p>It must be remembered in this connection, that in
those days game animals were enormously abundant
and comparatively tame, and also, that the Pawnees,
from the necessities of their lives, were tremendously
active, very swift runners, and as tireless as the
wolves from which they took their name. Their
endurance was something astonishing. In their long
journeys on the warpath they often traversed on foot
six or eight hundred miles of country, carrying, during
a part of the time, very heavy loads. Instances
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>252]</a></span>
are not uncommon where runners have traveled one
hundred miles in twenty-four hours. I myself know
of a case where two men ran over seventy miles in
eleven hours. We may imagine that in the old days
when the Pawnees made all their journeys on foot,
and were thus constantly exercising, their speed and
activity were greater, and their powers of endurance
still more remarkable.</p>

<p>Although their ancient arrows were usually headed
with flint, they sometimes used bone or the sharpened
tine of a deer&rsquo;s horn. No one now alive can remember
when these were in common use, but there are
men who have heard their fathers and their grandfathers
tell of them, and who say that these arrows
were good for war and for the chase. &ldquo;You could
drive them through a thick shield,&rdquo; said Bear Chief.
As soon as they began to trade with the whites,
arrow heads of sheet-iron came into use. They say
that, so long as the Pawnees used flint for making
arrow heads, they used to find plenty of these stones
lying on the prairie, but that when the whites brought
them iron, <i>Ti-ra&acute;-wa</i> said to himself, &ldquo;The Pawnees
no longer need these flint stones; I will make no
more of them.&rdquo; This shows an odd confusion of
ideas, for, of course, the reason that they did not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>253]</a></span>
find the stones was that they no longer looked for
them, their use having been abandoned.</p>

<p>Although these stone arrow heads must have
passed out of general use toward the end of the last
century, yet some of them were preserved much
later, and it is possible that there may even now be
some among the Pawnees, hidden away in the sacred
bundles. After they ceased to be used for general
purposes, they took on a sacred character and were
employed to slay the sacrifices; among the Skidi to
kill the captive, and in the Lower Village tribes the
buffalo and deer, for sacrifice. There was a time
when it was deemed essential that the animals to be
sacrificed to <i>Ti-ra&acute;-wa</i>, should be killed by one of
these ancient&mdash;and so sacred&mdash;arrows.</p>

<p>In the early days the Pawnees did not depend for
food wholly&mdash;perhaps not even largely&mdash;on the flesh
of the animals which they killed by hunting. They
have always been an agricultural people, cultivating
the ground, and raising corn, beans, pumpkins, and
squashes. They also dug up many edible roots, and
collected and dried various berries and other fruits.
Besides this, they captured birds and smaller mammals
by means of snares and traps. It is said that
before they obtained horses, they killed but few
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>254]</a></span>
buffalo, only enough to provide themselves with
clothing and with sinew for sewing, backing bows,
and other uses.</p>

<p>The Pawnees aver that they have cultivated the
corn as far back as they can remember. They say
also that this is their corn, that it is not the corn of
the whites, but is different from it&mdash;which is true&mdash;and
that they did not get it from the whites. It is their
own. On this they insist strenuously. I have found
it impossible to obtain any clue as to where the corn
came from or how they obtained it. To all inquiries
on this point, they reply that it must have been
&ldquo;handed down from above;&rdquo; that it was given them
by &ldquo;the Ruler.&rdquo; Various stories are told about it,
but none of them are very pointed or satisfactory.</p>

<p>They call the corn <i>a-ti&acute;ra</i>, &ldquo;mother.&rdquo; It has a
sacred character, and plays an important part in many
of their religious ceremonies. This name which they
give it, the mother corn, no doubt refers to the fact
that it nourishes and supports them; that by it they
are made strong. I have also heard it said that it
is called mother because it produces others; it has
young ones like a woman; &ldquo;you put it in the ground
and it brings forth others.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Pawnees cultivated their fields with hoes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>255]</a></span>
made from the shoulder blade of the buffalo. Taking
the ligament from the back of a buffalo&rsquo;s neck,
they lashed a stick firmly to the articulation of the
shoulder blade, nearly at right angles to the plane
of the bone and to its length. Then, dipping the
joint into hot water, the ligament would shrink, and
bind the bone and the handle together as firmly as
iron.</p>

<p>Years ago, on the sites of abandoned Pawnee villages,
on the Loup Fork and on the Platte, fragments
of pottery used to be found among the d&eacute;bris
of the fallen lodges. The manufacture of this pottery
was no doubt abandoned long ago, and has
probably not been practiced to any considerable
extent since they met the whites. A man about fifty
years of age stated to me that he had never seen
these pots in use, but that his grandmother had told
him that in her days they made and used them. He
said that they were accustomed to smooth off the
end of a tree for a mould. A hot fire was then built,
in which stones were roasted, which were afterward
pounded into fine powder or sand. This pounded
stone they mixed with fine clay, and when the material
was of the proper consistency, they smeared
it over the rounded mould, which was perhaps first
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>256]</a></span>
well greased with buffalo tallow. After the clay had
been made of even thickness throughout, and smooth
on the outside, they took a small, sharp stone, and
made marks on the outside to ornament it. When
the material was sufficiently dry, they lifted it from
the mould and burned it in the fire, and while it was
baking, &ldquo;put corn in the pot and stirred it about, and
this made it hard as iron.&rdquo; This may mean that it
gave the pot a glaze on the inside. In these pots
they boiled food of all kinds. Mr. Dunbar informs
me that these pots were also made in later times
within a frame-work of willow twigs. The clay,
made very stiff, was smeared on this frame, the inside
being repeatedly smoothed with the moistened hand,
and but little attention being given to the appearance
of the outside. After they had been sun-dried, such
pots were baked without removing the frame, which
burned away in the fire, leaving the marks of the
twigs visible on the outside of the pot.</p>

<p>Corn was, and is still, crushed in wooden mortars,
hollowed out by fire, and the pestle is also of wood,
about four feet long, with an enlargement at the
upper end to give added weight.</p>

<p>Dishes and bowls were made of wood, or of large
gourds; spoons and ladles were fashioned from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>257]</a></span>
horns of the buffalo; mats were woven of rushes,
ropes of buffalo hair, and lariats of rawhide.</p>

<p>Fire in the early days was obtained by means of
fire sticks, the point of one being twirled on a hollow
in the other, until the charred dust at first smoked
and then ignited. It is said that sometimes it would
take four men to make a fire, one relieving another
as they grew tired. It was hard, slow work, but
sometimes one man, if he was stout, could make a
fire alone. The use of fire sticks on war parties has
continued till within a short time, perhaps within
twenty years.</p>

<p>As their clothing was manufactured wholly from
skins, sewing occupied a considerable part of the
time of the women. This was done by means of a
bone needle&mdash;often the metacarpal or metatarsal
bone supporting the accessory hooflets on the deer&mdash;and
a thread twisted of sinews. Such sewing was
extremely durable.</p>

<p>The other implements and utensils of the Pawnees
did not differ materially from those of other plains
Indians.</p>

<p>It is a long time since they first began to use
articles and implements manufactured by the whites.
Curly Chief related to me the story of what was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>258]</a></span>
perhaps the first official visits from the whites ever received
by the Pawnees. He said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I heard that long ago there was a time when
there were no people in this country except Indians.
After that the people began to hear of men that had
white skins; they had been seen far to the east.
Before I was born they came out to our country and
visited us. The man who came was from the Government.
He wanted to make a treaty with us, and
to give us presents, blankets and guns, and flint and
steel, and knives.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Head Chief told him that we needed none
of these things. He said, &lsquo;We have our buffalo
and our corn. These things the Ruler gave to us,
and they are all that we need. See this robe. This
keeps me warm in winter. I need no blanket.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The white men had with them some cattle, and
the Pawnee Chief said, &lsquo;Lead out a heifer here on
the prairie.&rsquo; They led her out, and the Chief, stepping
up to her, shot her through behind the shoulder
with his arrow, and she fell down and died. Then
the Chief said, &lsquo;Will not my arrow kill? I do not
need your guns.&rsquo; Then he took his stone knife and
skinned the heifer, and cut off a piece of fat meat.
When he had done this he said, &lsquo;Why should I take
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>259]</a></span>
your knives? The Ruler has given me something to
cut with.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then taking the fire sticks, he kindled a fire to
roast the meat, and while it was cooking, he spoke
again and said, &lsquo;You see, my brother, that the
Ruler has given us all that we need; the buffalo for
food and clothing; the corn to eat with our dried
meat; bows, arrows, knives and hoes; all the implements
which we need for killing meat, or for cultivating
the ground. Now go back to the country
from whence you came. We do not want your presents,
and we do not want you to come into our
country.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Afterward, however, a treaty was made. The
first treaties were not to purchase land. The Government
made presents, and bought the right to pass
through the country. Roads were made up the
Republican, the Platte and the Solomon rivers.&rdquo;</p>


<h4><a name="notes_2_2" id="notes_2_2"></a>II. EVERY-DAY LIFE.</h4>

<p>In these hasty remarks upon the ways of the Pawnees,
which are in fact no more than a series of
rough notes supplementary to Mr. Dunbar&rsquo;s fuller
history of this people, I shall not attempt to give
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>260]</a></span>
any general account of their habits. These can be
learned by reference to the papers, so often quoted.
My object is to give a picture of the Pawnee ways
of thought rather than of their material life.</p>

<p>Their government was semi-republican. They
were ruled by a head chief, in later times always the
head chief of the Chau-i band; and this title was
hereditary, but the chief, if he had not the requisite
strength of character, might lose all his influence,
and his position be practically, though not in name,
held by a sub-chief or even warrior of his own or
another band. As has been well said, &ldquo;The office
itself was hereditary, but authority could be gained
only by acknowledged personal accomplishments.&rdquo;
Each band was ruled as to its own affairs by four
chiefs&mdash;a head chief, second chief, third and fourth
chiefs&mdash;but often some warrior who held no office,
and bore no title, might wield more power and influence
than any of these. In minor matters, the chief
gave his orders without consultation with any one,
but more important affairs were usually discussed in
council by chiefs, head men and warriors, and the
opinion of the assemblage prevailed, even if it were
opposed to the opinion of the chief. Among the
Pawnees, as elsewhere, a man&rsquo;s personal character
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>261]</a></span>
determined the position he should occupy and the
influence he should wield. Bravery, wisdom, and
personal popularity were the important factors in
acquiring and retaining influence and authority.</p>

<p>Mr. Dunbar alludes to one matter which is little
understood in general; that is the existence among
the Pawnees of a class of servants. These were for
the most part young men, or boys growing up, who
had not yet acquired any special standing. They
lived in the family of men of position and influence,
from whom they received support, and for whom
they performed many offices, which were almost
menial. The relation which they held to the head
of the family was not altogether unlike that of a
page or a squire to his knight in medi&aelig;val times.
These young men drove in and saddled the horses,
made the fires, ran errands, and carried messages
for the leaders whom they followed. The same
menial offices were often performed by other, older
men, who were too lazy and too worthless to make
positions for themselves, and who were willing to
continue to serve for their support. This relation
of servant persisted even among the Pawnee Scouts
after their enlistment, and, while among the privates
in this body all were of course equal in name, it was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>262]</a></span>
yet common, as the camp prepared to start in the
morning, to see the younger men saddling up the
horses, and performing other duties for the chiefs
and the proved warriors, whose military standing
was no higher than those who were serving them.</p>

<p>The dress of the old-time Pawnee male consisted
of a breech clout, leggings, fringed at the side, and
reaching from ankle to thigh, and moccasins. Over
all this, when the weather demanded it, was worn
the buffalo robe, the hair side being turned in. The
dress of the women consisted of a sort of sleeveless
shirt, and a skirt of dressed buffalo cow skin, reaching
to below the knee, with leggings of cloth or
buckskin, laced above the knee, and moccasins.
They also wore the robe or blanket. No head covering
was used, though in war and on great occasions
the men wore bonnets or chaplets of eagle
feathers, and sometimes both men and women wove
wreaths out of cottonwood or willow twigs, with the
green leaves left on, to shade their eyes from the
fierce rays of the sun. The children were at first
scantily clad. The boy, after he was released from
his board, went naked, except perhaps for a string
of beads around his neck, until he was ten or twelve
years old, though usually he assumed the breech
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>263]</a></span>
clout before that age. Girls were clad in a shirt or
smock almost as soon as they could walk.</p>

<p>At the present time but few of the Pawnees wear
their hair cut in the ancient fashion, but twenty
years ago a large proportion of the older men had
the whole head shaved, except a narrow roach
which ran from the forehead to the back of the
head. This roach, on which the hair was usually
left less than an inch long, was sometimes stiffened
at the sides with grease and paint to make it stand
up well. From this roach the scalp lock fell back in
its natural position. At the present day many of the
men cut their hair short, like the whites. The women
usually wore their hair in two braids, one on each
side, falling behind the ears, and the younger ones
were careful in tending it.</p>

<p>All hair upon the face and on other parts of the
body was usually plucked out, but I have seen a
Pawnee with a heavy beard under his chin.</p>

<p>Paint was freely used in ornamentation, especially
on the face and breast. Black, as is the case with
most tribes, was the color for war. Red, white and
yellow, were used merely for ornament.</p>

<p>As already indicated, the arms of the Pawnees
were the bow and arrow, the lance, the club, and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>264]</a></span>
hatchet. The bow was almost invariably made of
the <i>bois d&rsquo;arc</i>, and was backed with sinew, and had a
string of the same material. The arrows were made
with the greatest labor, care and exactness, and those
manufactured by each individual were so marked
that they could at once be distinguished from those
of every other maker. It is well known that the
arrows of each Indian tribe differed from those of
every other tribe, but besides this, each man&rsquo;s arrows
bore his private mark. The manufacture of the bow
and arrows was a long, slow process, and after they
had been completed they were carefully guarded and
protected from injury. Although the Pawnees have
long been accustomed to use firearms in war, yet the
use of the bow and arrow in hunting persisted up to
quite recent times, in fact up to the date of the disappearance
of the buffalo. A reason for this is
readily found in the fact that an arrow cost only
time to manufacture, and the Indian has an abundance
of time. For cartridges, or for powder and
lead, he must pay money, or trade some of his possessions.
An arrow, too, may be used over and over
again, and may thus account for many head of game,
whereas a cartridge can be used but once. In their
secret war expeditions, too, the bow was a favorite
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>265]</a></span>
weapon, because it was noiseless. An enemy found
at a little distance from his camp, could be stealthily
approached and silently shot down, without necessarily
alarming persons in the neighborhood, when
a rifle shot, ringing over the prairie and echoing
among the bluffs, would call out every warrior in
the village, to learn whence it came. I have been
told, by warriors, that on their war parties, they left
their rifles at home and carried only their bows, so
that they might not be tempted by the sight of an
enemy to fire a shot, which might bring themselves
and their companions into danger.</p>

<p>The Pawnees were superb horsemen and owned
many ponies. I can learn nothing definite as to
when they first obtained these animals, nor from
what source. A tradition exists, that up to the time
of the tribe&rsquo;s advent into the northern country, their
only beast of burden was the dog, which then carried
their packs and hauled their <i>travois</i>. The story goes
that the Pawnees obtained their first horses soon
after their separation from the Wichitas. The three
bands were traveling north together, when the scouts
who had been sent ahead to overlook the country,
hastened back and announced to the chiefs that they
had discovered a camp of Indians. A council was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>266]</a></span>
at once held to determine whether they should attack
this unknown village as enemies, or should approach
them as friends. The majority declared for
an attack, and it was so decided. Approaching
under cover as near as possible, the horde of dusky
footmen poured over the hills and down into the
valley where stood the doomed village. The attack
was sudden, fierce, and successful. They killed and
captured many of the enemy, and took the camp,
while the survivors fled in hopeless confusion.
Among the plunder taken were a lot of horses;
strange beasts then to the rude Pawnees, and at
which they wondered greatly. A captive woman
explained to the conquerors that these creatures
were good to ride, and useful to pack on. Old men
still tell, with a smile, of the ludicrous first attempts
of the warriors to ride the horses. This occurrence
is said to have taken place on the Smoky Hill River,
in what is now Kansas, and the Indians from whom
the horses were captured, are understood to have
been Cheyennes.</p>

<p class="caption">COW SKIN LODGE.</p>

<p>The permanent habitations of the Pawnees were
dirt or sod houses, often of very considerable size.
The remains of the old medicine lodge of the Skidi,
on the Loup, show it to have been two hundred and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267"><!-- original location of Cow Skin Lodge illustration --></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>268]</a></span>
ten feet in diameter. The lodges were circular in
form, with walls seven or eight feet high, and the
roof rose from these walls to the apex above the
center of the lodge, where was the hole for the
escape of smoke from the fire, which burned on the
floor below. A covered passageway led to the entrance.
Around the walls the inmates slept, the
beds being partitioned off, and protected in front
as well, by a curtain which might be a skin, or a mat
woven of reeds or coarse grass. The cooking was
all done over the fire in the middle of the lodge.
Possessions were stowed away behind the beds, or
hung up on the posts which supported the roof.</p>

<p>On their hunts or when traveling, the Pawnees
used the ordinary cow skin lodge of the plains
Indians. This was composed of neatly dressed
buffalo hides, from which the hair had been removed,
set up over a frame-work, made up, usually, of sixteen
long slender poles. An opening at the top gave
exit to the smoke; and wings, projecting at either
side of the smoke hole, and so arranged that their
positions could be changed by moving two additional
poles on the outside of the lodge, served to
regulate the draft, and keep the lodge free from
smoke. The inmates slept close to the walls, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>269]</a></span>
the fire, with the inevitable pot hanging over it,
burned in the middle. These lodges were warm, and
usually dry, and made good shelters. They were
occupied for the greater part of the year, for the
Pawnees, after the spring planting was fairly over,
usually started at once on their summer hunt, from
which they only returned in time to harvest their
crops. At the beginning of winter, when the robes
were at their best, they made the winter hunt, from
which they did not return until toward spring. The
planting over, they set out again on the hunt.</p>

<p>In their personal intercourse with each other, and
with strangers, the Pawnees were kindly and
accommodating. I have had little kindnesses unostentatiously
done me by Pawnee men, such as I
should never expect to receive from white persons
not connected with me by ties of blood. In the village,
the well-to-do gave freely to those who were
poor, and all were very hospitable. They were a
light-hearted, merry race, keenly alive to the ridiculous,
and very fond of a joke. They were great
chatterers, and had about them nothing of the supposed
taciturnity of the Indian. Of modesty or
delicacy in conversation, as we know it, they had
none. Both sexes spoke freely to each other of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>270]</a></span>
matters which are never mentioned in civilized
society, and much of their conversation, as well as
many of their stories, could not well be printed.</p>


<h4><a name="notes_2_3" id="notes_2_3"></a>III. A SUMMER HUNT.</h4>

<p>It was in the month of July, 1872. The Pawnees
were preparing to start on their semi-annual buffalo
hunt, and only the last religious rites remained to be
performed before the nation should leave the village
for the buffalo range.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Eh, idadi, whoop</i>,&rdquo; came from without the lodge;
and as I replied, &ldquo;<i>Ehya, whoop</i>,&rdquo; the sturdy figure of
<i>Le-ta-kats-ta&acute;-ka</i> appeared in the doorway.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Lau, idad, t&#365;t-t&#363;-ta-rik ti-rah-r&#275;k</i>&mdash;Come, brother,
they are going to dance,&rdquo; he said, and then he turned
and went out.</p>

<p>I rose from the pile of robes on which I had been
dozing, and, after rolling them up, strolled out after
him. The village seemed deserted, but off toward
the medicine lodge, which stood upon its outskirts,
I could see a throng of Indians; and a low murmur
of voices and of footsteps, the hum which always
accompanies any large assemblage, was borne to my
ears on the evening breeze. The ceremonies, which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>271]</a></span>
comprised the consecration of the buffalo staves and
the buffalo dance, were about to begin. The great
dirt lodge was crowded. I pushed my way through
the throng of women and boys, who made up the
outer circle of spectators, and soon found myself
among the men, who made way for me, until I
reached a position from which I could see all that
was going on within the circle about which they
stood.</p>

<p>For several days the priests and the doctors had
been preparing for this solemn religious ceremonial.
They had fasted long; earnest prayers had been
made to <i>Ti-ra&acute;-wa</i>, and sacrifices had been offered.
Now the twelve buffalo skulls had been arranged on
the ground in a half-circle, and near them stood the
chiefs and doctors, reverently holding in their hands
the buffalo staves and sacred bows and arrows, and
other implements of the chase. For a little while
they stood silent, with bowed heads, but presently
one and then another began to murmur their petitions
to <i>A-ti-us Ti-ra&acute;-wa</i>, the Spirit Father. At
first their voices were low and mumbling, but gradually
they became more earnest and lifted their eyes
toward heaven. It was impossible to distinguish
what each one said, but now and then disjointed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>272]</a></span>
sentences reached me. &ldquo;Father, you are the Ruler&mdash;We
are poor&mdash;Take pity on us&mdash;Send us plenty of
buffalo, plenty of fat cows&mdash;Father, we are your
children&mdash;help the people&mdash;send us plenty of meat,
so that we may be strong, and our bodies may increase
and our flesh grow hard&mdash;Father, you see us,
listen.&rdquo; As they prayed they moved their hands
backward and forward over the implements which
they held, and at length reverently deposited them
on the ground within the line of buffalo skulls, and
then stepped back, still continuing their prayers.</p>

<p>It was a touching sight to witness these men calling
upon their God for help. All of them had passed
middle life, and some were gray-haired, blind and
tottering; but they prayed with a fervor and earnestness
that compelled respect. They threw their souls
into their prayers, and as a son might entreat his
earthly father for some great gift, so they plead with
<i>Ti-ra&acute;-wa</i>. Their bodies quivered with emotion, and
great drops of sweat stood upon their brows. They
were thoroughly sincere.</p>

<p>After the last of the articles had been placed upon
the ground, their voices grew lower and at length
died away. A moment later a drum sounded, and a
dozen or twenty young warriors sprang into the circle
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>273]</a></span>
and began the buffalo dance. This was kept up
without intermission for three days, and as soon as
it was over, the tribe moved out of the village on the
hunt.</p>

<p>From the village on the Loup, we traveled southward;
for in those days the region between the
Platte and the Smoky rivers swarmed with buffalo.
With the Pawnees were a few Poncas, Omahas and
Otoes, so that there were about four thousand
Indians in the camp. It was the summer hunt of
the tribe. Twice each year the agent permitted
them to visit the buffalo range. The meat which
they killed and dried on these hunts, the corn and
squashes which they grew on their farms, and the small
annuities received from the Government, were all
they had to subsist on from season to season. Thus
the occasion was one of importance to the Indians.
Perhaps only the older heads among them fully
appreciated its economic interest; but for all it was
a holiday time; a temporary escape from confinement.
Life on the reservation was monotonous.
There was nothing to do except to sit in the sun and
smoke, and tell stories of the former glories of the
nation; of successful fights with the Sioux and
Cheyennes, and of horse stealing expeditions, from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>274]</a></span>
which the heroes had returned with great herds of
ponies and much glory. Now, for a little while,
they returned to the old free life of earlier years,
when the land had been all their own, and they had
wandered at will over the broad expanse of the rolling
prairie. Now, for a time, it was as it had been
before the cornfields of the white man had begun to
dot their river bottoms, before the sound of his rifle
had made wild their game, before the locomotive&rsquo;s
whistle had shrieked through the still, hot summer
air. Half a year&rsquo;s provision was now to be secured.
The comfort&mdash;almost the existence&mdash;of the tribe for
the next six months depended on the accumulation
of an abundant supply of dried buffalo meat, and no
precaution was omitted to make the hunt successful.
It would not do to permit each individual to hunt
independently. Indiscriminate buffalo running by
six or eight hundred men scattered over the prairie,
each one working for himself alone, would result in
the killing of some few buffalo, but would terrify and
drive away all the others in the neighborhood. This
matter was too important to be trusted to chance.
The hunting was systematized.</p>

<p>The government of the hunt was intrusted to the
Pawnee soldiers. These were twenty-four warriors
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>275]</a></span>
of mature age, not so old as to be unfitted for active
work, yet with the fires of early youth somewhat
tempered by years of experience; men whose judgment
and discretion could at all times be relied on.
These soldiers acted under the chiefs, but the practical
guidance of the hunt was wholly in their hands.
They determined the direction and length of each
day&rsquo;s march, and the spot for camping. They
selected the young men who should act as scouts,
and arranged all the details of the approach and the
charge when a herd of buffalo was discovered large
enough to call for a general surround. All the men
were under their control, and amenable to their discipline.
They did not hesitate to exercise their
authority, nor to severely punish any one who committed
an act by which the success of the hunt might
be imperilled.</p>

<p>The scouts sent out by the soldiers were chosen
from among the younger men. They acted merely
as spies, their office was to find the buffalo. They
moved rapidly along, far in advance of the marching
column, and from the tops of the highest hills carefully
scanned the country before them in search of
buffalo. If a herd was discerned, they were not to
show themselves, nor in any way to alarm it. Having
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>276]</a></span>
found the game, their duty was to observe its movement,
learn where it was likely to be for the next few
hours, and then to report as quickly as possible to
the camp. The soldiers then determined what
action should be taken. If the news was received
late in the day, and the buffalo were at some distance,
the camp would probably be moved as near as
practicable to where the herd was feeding, and the
chase would take place in the early morning. If, on
the other hand, the scouts found the herd in the
morning, the men would start off at once for the
surround, leaving the women to follow, and make
camp as near as possible to where the dead buffalo
lay.</p>

<p>Day after day we traveled southward, crossing the
Platte River, and then the Republican about due
south of the present flourishing town of Kearney.
South of the Platte a few scattering buffalo were
found, but no large herds had been met with&mdash;nothing
that called for a surround. At length we
camped one night on the Beaver, a small affluent of
the Republican, emptying into it from the south.</p>

<p>With the gray dawn of morning, the camp, as usual,
is astir. By the time our little party have turned
out of our blankets, some of the Indians have already
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>277]</a></span>
finished eating, and are catching up their horses and
preparing to ride off over the bluffs, leaving the
squaws to take down the lodges, pack the ponies,
and pursue the designated line of march. Before
we are ready to &ldquo;pull out,&rdquo; most of the ponies have
been packed, and a long, irregular line of Indians is
creeping across the level valley, and beginning to
wind up the face of the bluffs. The procession
moves slowly, proceeding at a walk. Most of those
who remain with the column are on foot, the squaws
leading the ponies, and many of the men, wrapped
in their blankets, and with only their bows and
arrows on their backs, walking briskly over the prairie,
a little to one side. These last are the poorer Indians&mdash;those
who have but few horses. They travel
on foot, letting their horses run without burdens, so
that they may be fresh and strong, whenever they
shall be needed for running the buffalo.</p>

<p>Side by side, at the head of the column, walk
eight men who carry the buffalo staves. These are
slender spruce poles, like a short lodge-pole, wrapped
with blue and red cloth, and elaborately ornamented
with bead work, and with the feathers of hawks, and
of the war eagle. These sticks are carried by men
selected by the chiefs and doctors in private council,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>278]</a></span>
and are religiously guarded. Upon the care of these
emblems, and the respect paid to them, depends, in
a great measure, the success of the hunt. While
borne before the moving column, no one is permitted
to cross the line of march in front of them.</p>

<p>Close behind the staff bearers follow a number of
the principal men of the tribe; the head chief, old
<i>Pi&acute;ta Le-shar</i>, and a dozen or fifteen sub-chiefs or
head men, all mounted on superb horses. Behind
them comes the camp at large, a fantastically
mingled multitude, marching without any appearance
of order. Here most of the individuals are
women, young girls and children, for the men who
accompany the camp usually march singly, or by
twos and threes, a little apart from the mob. Most
of those rich enough in horses to be able to ride at
all times, are scattered over the prairie for miles in
every direction, picking up the small bands of buffalo,
which have been passed by the scouts as not
large enough to call for a general surround. The
hunters are careful, however, not to follow too close
upon the advance line, whose movements they can
readily observe upon the bare bluffs far ahead of
them.</p>

<p>At the time of which I am writing, the Pawnees
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>279]</a></span>
had no wagons, all their possessions being transported
on pack horses. The Indian pack pony is
apt to be old and sedate, requiring no special
guidance nor control. A strip of rawhide, knotted
about the lower jaw, serves as a bridle, and is either
tied up to the saddle or held in the rider&rsquo;s hand. In
packing the animals a bundle of lodge-poles is tied
on either side of the saddle, one end projecting forward
toward the horse&rsquo;s head, the other dragging on
the ground behind. This is the <i>travois</i>. Cross poles
are often tied between these two dragging bundles,
and on these are carried packages of meat and robes.
Often, too, on a robe stretched between them, a sick
or wounded Indian, unable to ride, is transported.
The lodge-poles having been fastened to the saddle,
the lodge is folded up and placed on it between
them, and blankets, robes, and other articles are
piled on top of this, until the horse has on its back
what appears to be about as much as it can carry.
The pack is then lashed firmly in position, and pots,
buckets and other utensils are tied about it wherever
there is room.</p>

<p>On top of the load so arranged one or two women,
or three or four children, clamber and settle themselves
comfortably there, and the old horse is turned
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>280]</a></span>
loose. Each rider carries in her hand a whip, with
which she strikes the horse at every step, not cruelly
at all, but just from force of habit. If the pack is
low, so that her feet reach down to the animal&rsquo;s sides,
she keeps up also a constant drumming on his ribs
with her heels. The old horse pays not the slightest
attention to any of these demonstrations of impatience,
but plods steadily along at a quiet walk, his
eyes half closed and his ears nodding at each step.
If the riders are women, each one holds a child or
two in her arms, or on her back, or perhaps the baby
board is hung over the end of a lodge-pole, and
swings free. If the living load consists of children,
they have in their arms a lot of puppies; for puppies
occupy with relation to the small Indian girls
the place which dolls hold among the white children.
Many of the pack animals are mares with young
colts, and these last, instead of following quietly at
their mothers&rsquo; heels, range here and there, sometimes
before and sometimes behind, their dams.
They are thus constantly getting lost in the crowd,
and then they charge backward and forward in wild
affright, neighing shrilly, until they have again found
their proper place in the line of march. Many of
the yearling colts have very small and light packs
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>281]</a></span>
tied on their backs, while the two-year-olds are often
ridden by the tiniest of Indian boys, who are now
giving them their first lesson in weight-carrying.
Loose horses of all ages roam about at will, and their
continual cries mingle with the barking of dogs, the
calls of women and the yells of boys, and make an
unceasing noise.</p>

<p>The boys are boiling over with animal spirits, and,
like their civilized brothers of the same age, are continually
running about, chasing each other, wrestling,
shooting arrows and playing games, of which the
familiar stick game seems the favorite.</p>

<p>Whenever the column draws near any cover,
which may shelter game, such as a few bushes in a
ravine, or the fringe of low willows along some little
watercourse, the younger men and boys scatter out
and surround it. They beat it in the most thorough
manner, and any game which it contains is driven
out on the prairie, surrounded and killed. The appearance
even of a jackass rabbit throws the boys
into a fever of excitement, and causes them to shriek
and yell as if in a frenzy.</p>

<p>All the morning I rode with the Indians, either at
the head of the column, chatting as best I could with
<i>Pi&acute;ta Le-shar</i> and other chiefs, or falling back and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>282]</a></span>
riding among the women and children, whom I never
tired of watching. Frequently during the day I saw
at a distance, on the prairie, small bunches of buffalo
in full flight, hotly pursued by dark-skinned riders,
and occasionally two or three men would ride up to
the marching columns with heavy loads of freshly-killed
meat. The quick-heaving, wet flanks of the
ponies told a story of sharp, rapid chases, and their
tossing heads and eager, excited looks showed how
much interest they took in the hunt.</p>

<p>The report of firearms was seldom heard. Most
of the Indians hunted with the primitive weapon of
their forefathers&mdash;the bow and arrow. For buffalo
running an arrow is nearly as effective as lead. The
power of the bow in expert hands is tremendous.
Riding within half a dozen yards of the victim&rsquo;s side,
the practiced bowman will drive the dart so far
through the body of the buffalo that its shaft
may project a foot or more from the opposite side&mdash;sometimes
indeed may pass quite through. Besides,
the bow can be used very rapidly and accurately. I
have seen an Indian take a sheaf of six arrows in his
hand, and discharge them at a mark more rapidly
and with more certainty of hitting his target than I
could fire the six barrels of a revolver.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>283]</a></span>
It was nearly noon, and I was riding along at the
head of the column. I had but one horse, and did
not care to wear him out by chasing around over the
prairie, preferring to save him for some great
effort. We were traveling along a smooth divide between
two sets of ravines, which ran off, one to the
east and the other to the west. <i>Pi&acute;ta Le-shar</i> had
just informed me by signs that we should make camp
about two miles further on, by a stream whose course
we could trace from where we then were. Suddenly,
without the slightest warning, the huge dark bodies
of half a dozen buffalo sprang into view, rising out
of a ravine on our left not a hundred yards distant.
When they saw the multitude before them, they
stopped and stared at us.</p>

<p>They were too close for me to resist the temptation
to pursue. As I lifted the reins from my pony&rsquo;s
neck and bent forward, the little animal sprang into
a sharp gallop toward the game, and as he did so I
saw half a dozen Indians shoot out from the column
and follow me. The buffalo wheeled, and in an instant
were out of sight, but when I reached the edge
of the bank down which they had plunged, I could
see through the cloud of dust, which they left behind
them, their uncouth forms dashing down the ravine.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>284]</a></span>
My nimble pony, as eager for the race as his rider,
hurled himself down the steep pitch, and sped along
the narrow broken bed of the gully. I could feel
that sometimes he would lengthen his stride to leap
wide ditches, where the water from some side ravine
had cut away the ground, but I never knew of these
until they were passed. My eyes were fixed on the
fleeing herd; my ears were intent on the pursuing
horsemen. Close behind me I could hear the quick
pounding of many hoofs, and could feel that one of
the horses, nearer than the rest, was steadily drawing
up to me&mdash;but I was gaining on the buffalo. Already
the confused rumble of their hoof-beats almost
drowned those of the horses behind me, and the air
was full of the dust and small pebbles thrown up by
their hurrying feet. But they were still ahead of me,
and the gulch was so narrow that I could not shoot.
The leading horseman drew nearer and nearer, and
was now almost at my side. I could see the lean
head and long, slim neck of his pony under my right
arm, and could hear the rider speak to his horse and
urge him forward in the race. My horse did his best,
but the other had the most speed. He shot by me,
and a moment later was alongside the last buffalo.</p>

<p>As he passed me the young Indian made a laughing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>285]</a></span>
gesture of triumph, slipped an arrow on his bowstring,
and drew it to its head; but just as he was
about to let it fly, his horse, which was but a colt,
took fright at the huge animal which it had overtaken,
and shied violently to the right, almost unseating
its rider. At the same moment the buffalo
swerved a little to the left, and thus lost a few feet.
Truly, the race is not always to the swift. As I
passed the Indian, I could not restrain a little whoop
of satisfaction, and then swinging my rifle around,
I fired. The buffalo fell in its stride, tossing up a
mighty cloud of the soft yellow earth, and my pony
ran by him fifty yards before he could be checked.
Then I turned and rode back to look at the game.
The other Indians had passed me like a whirlwind,
and, close at the heels of the herd, had swept around
a point of bluff and out of sight. Only my rival
remained, and he was excitedly arguing with his
horse. The logic of a whip-handle, applied with
vigor about the creature&rsquo;s ears, convinced it that it
must approach the dead buffalo; and then the rider
dismounting, and passing his lariat about the animal&rsquo;s
horns, drew the pony&rsquo;s head to within a few feet of
the terrifying mass, and fastened the rope. When
he had accomplished this, he grinned pleasantly at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>286]</a></span>
me, and I responded in kind, and in dumb show
transferred to him all my right and title in the dead
buffalo. At this he smiled still more cheerfully, and
set to work &ldquo;butchering.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The animal was a superb specimen, just entering
his prime, and was fat, round and sleek. His horns
were symmetrically curved and beautifully polished.
Not a scratch marred their shining surfaces, nor a
splinter was frayed from their sharp points. The
sweeping black beard was long and full, and the
thick curls upon his hump and massive shoulders
were soft and deep, while the short hair of his sides
and hips was smooth as the coat of a horse. His
size was enormous. It seemed that he would have
turned the scale at quite two thousand pounds. Certainly
his weight exceeded that of both the fifteen-hand
ponies that stood beside him.</p>

<p>A few moments later, I was again in the saddle,
and riding on along the course taken by the remaining
buffalo, for I was anxious to see what had
become of them. On rounding the point of the
bluff, where I had last seen them, my curiosity was
satisfied. The valley here widened out until it was
perhaps sixty yards across, and on either side rose
vertical bluffs of yellow chalk to a height of forty
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>287]</a></span>
feet. Scattered about over the little plain, lay half a
dozen buffalo, over each of which bent one or two
Indians busily plying the knife. At the foot of the
bluff at one side of the valley stood four or five
others, looking at a cow, perched on a narrow shelf
ten feet below the top. I shall never understand how
that animal reached the position it occupied. There
was evidently no way of getting to it except by jumping
up from below, which was obviously impossible&mdash;or
down from above, which seemed out of the question.
The shelf was so short that the animal could
move neither backward nor forward, and was just wide
enough for it to stand on. As I rode up and joined
the little group below it, the head and shoulders of a
middle-aged Indian appeared over the top of the
bluff, above the cow. He lay down flat on his breast,
and holding in both hands an old-fashioned muzzle-loading
pistol, attempted to shoot the cow from
above, but his old arm would not go off. He
snapped it half a dozen times, and then, discouraged,
called out something to us below. One of the boys
turned to me, and said very slowly and distinctly,
&ldquo;He say, you shoot.&rdquo; I therefore dismounted, and
fired at the cow, which responded by shaking her
head angrily, and whisking her short tail. Another
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>288]</a></span>
call came from the old fellow on top of the bluff, and
the young man said to me, &ldquo;He say, you hit her;
right spot.&rdquo; A moment later, the cow bent forward
and fell on her knees, and the Indian above dropped
down on her back.</p>

<p>Turning my horse&rsquo;s head in the direction from
which I had come, I rode up through a side ravine
on to the high prairie. A mile away I could see the
column of marching Indians, plodding along at their
old slow pace. Here and there, over the rolling
hills, dark forms were visible, some of them in rapid
motion, others apparently stationary. Often it was
impossible to determine whether these figures
were horsemen or buffalo, but sometimes, far away,
I could see a mimic chase in which pursuer and pursued
appeared no larger than ants.</p>

<p>As I came up with the Indians, they were just descending
into the stream bottom, where camp was to
be made. The small boys had, as usual, dispersed
themselves over the valley and among the underbrush.
Many of the squaws, leaving the ponies and
packs to their sister-wives or children, were hurrying
up or down the stream to gather wood. Already
the leading ponies were being relieved of their loads.
Suddenly, from the mouth of a little ravine coming
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>289]</a></span>
down into the stream bottom, rose a chorus of shrill
yelps and shrieks from childish throats, and a gang
of wild turkeys were seen, running rapidly through
the high grass toward the hills. A moment later,
with a loud <i>quit-quit</i> of alarm, they took wing, but not
before several of their number had fallen before the
missiles of the boys. Most of them went up or down
the creek, but one inexperienced bird took its course
directly over our heads.</p>

<p>Those who have seen the Indian only on dress
parade, talk of his stolidity, impassiveness, and his
marvelous control over his countenance and his
emotions. This demeanor he can and does assume,
and when he is with white men, or among strangers,
he is usually all that he has been pictured; but take
him by himself, and he expresses his feelings with as
little restraint as a child. So it was now. No grave
chief, nor battle-scarred warrior, nor mighty worker of
<i>ti-war&acute;-uks-ti</i> (magic) was too dignified to express
his interest at the appearance of this great bird sailing
laboriously along, thirty or forty feet above him.
It was as if the turkey had flown over a great company
of schoolboys, and the utter abandonment of
the excited multitude, the entire absence of restraint,
the perfect naturalness of the expression of feeling,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>290]</a></span>
had in them something very delightful and infectious.
Every Indian, who held in his hand anything
that was light enough to throw, hurled it at the bird,
and a cloud of whips, sticks, hatchets, fleshers, and
arrows, rose to meet it as it passed along. One
missile knocked from its tail a few long feathers,
which drifted slowly down on the heads of the
people. It kept on, but before it had passed beyond
the long line of Indians extending back over the
plain, its strength became exhausted, it came to the
ground, and was at once dispatched by those nearest
to it.</p>

<p>Almost before the turkey&rsquo;s fate had been decided,
many of the lodges had been pitched, and now the
slender gray columns from a hundred camp-fires
began to climb up through the still air toward the
blue above. The women were hard at work cooking,
or spreading out freshly killed robes, or putting
up drying scaffolds, while the men lounged in the
shade and smoked or chatted. Our wagon was
halted at one side of the camp, and the tired horses
and mules stripped of saddles and harness, and
picketed near at hand. The Indian pack ponies
were collected and driven off on the upland in
charge of several boys.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>291]</a></span>
We had invitations to eat meat at several lodges
that day. Usually we did not accept these freely
proffered hospitalities, because we had no means of
returning them, but one of these invitations came
from a particular friend, and to-day we broke
through our rule. We feasted on roast ribs, <i>ka&acute;wis</i>,
and dried meat, and really had a delightful time.
It was about three o&rsquo;clock when we finished the
meal, and we were lounging about the lodge, smoking
and chatting, in lazy after-dinner fashion, when
we were startled by a series of yells and shouts,
among which I distinguished the words &ldquo;<i>Cha&acute;-ra-rat
wa-ta&acute;</i>&mdash;The Sioux are coming.&rdquo; Our Indian
companions snatched up their arms, and rushed out
of the lodge, and we were not slow in following.
&ldquo;<i>S&#363;ks-e-kitta-wit w&#301;s-k&#363;ts</i>&mdash;Get on your horses
quick,&rdquo; shouted our host. The camp was in a state
of wild excitement. Naked men were running to
their horses, and jerking their lariats from the picket
pins, sprang on their backs and rode hard for the
hills; while women and boys rushed about, catching
horses, and bringing them in among the lodges,
where they were securely fastened. Less than a
mile away, we saw the horse herd dashing along at
top speed, and a little to one side of it a horseman
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>292]</a></span>
riding in circles, and waving his blanket before him.
It was evident that the Sioux were trying to run off
the herd. We ran as hard as we could to the wagon,
caught up rifles and cartridge belts, and buckling
on the latter as we ran, kept on to the horses. There
was no time to saddle up. We looped the ropes
around their jaws, sprang on their naked backs, and
were off. As we rode up on the prairie, the herd of
ponies thundered by, and swept down the bluffs to
the camp. The rolling expanse before us was dotted
with Indians, each one urging forward his horse to
its utmost speed. Many of them were already a
long way in advance, and were passing over the
furthest high bluff, which seemed to rise up and
meet the sky. Hard as we might push our ponies,
there was little hope that we would be in time to
have any hand in the encounter&mdash;if one took place&mdash;between
the Pawnees and their hereditary foes.</p>

<p>We kept on until we reached the crest of the high
bluff. From here we could see far off over the plain,
dozens of black dots strung out after one another.
Nearer at hand, other Indians, whose steeds, like
ours, had proved too slow for the swift pursuit, were
riding back toward us, showing in their faces the
disappointment which they felt at being left behind.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>293]</a></span>
With these we turned about, and rode toward the
camp. Among them was one of the herd boys, for
the moment a hero, who had to repeat his story
again and again. He had been sitting on top of a
hill, not far from the horses, when he discovered
several Sioux stealing toward them through a ravine.
Signaling his comrades, they succeeded in getting
the herd in motion before the robbers had approached
very close to them. Eight of the slowest
horses had dropped behind during the flight, and
had no doubt fallen into the hands of the enemy.</p>

<p>One by one, the Indians came straggling back to
camp during the afternoon and evening, but it was
not until late that night that the main body of the
pursuers came in. They had ten extra horses, two
of which they had taken in turn from the Sioux.
They had no scalps, however, for they had been unable
to overtake the enemy.</p>

<p>Long we sat that night by the fire in <i>Pi&acute;ta Le-shar&rsquo;s</i>
lodge, talking over the exciting event of the afternoon;
and as we rose to go to our wagons, and said
good night, the old man, who had been silently gazing
into the coals for some time, looked up at me
and smiled, saying, &ldquo;<i>Wa-ti-hes ti-k&#333;t-it ti-ra-hah</i>&mdash;To-morrow
we will kill buffalo.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>294]</a></span>
When we turned out of our blankets the next
morning, a heavy mist hung over the prairie. This
was unfortunate, for so long as the fog lasted it
would be impossible for the scouts to see far enough
to discover the buffalo. The first few hours of the
march were uneventful. Once or twice the huge
bodies of a small band of buffalo loomed up through
the white mist about us, their size and shape greatly
exaggerated and distorted by its deceptive effect.
As the sun climbed toward the zenith, the air grew
brighter, and by mid-day the fog had risen from the
ground, and though still clinging in white cottony
wreaths about the tops of the higher bluffs near us,
we now could see for quite a long distance over the
prairie. A little later the sun burst forth, and the
sky became clear. Soon after noon we went into
camp.</p>

<p>We had but just begun our dinner, when a runner
was seen coming at full gallop down the bluffs. It
was one of the scouts. He dashed through the village,
and did not check his pony&rsquo;s speed until he
had reached old <i>Pi&acute;ta Le-shar&rsquo;s</i> lodge. Here he
stopped, and bending from his horse spoke a few
words very earnestly, gesticulating and pointing
back over the prairie in the direction whence he had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>295]</a></span>
come. As he rode on and past us, he called out,
&ldquo;<i>Te-co&acute;di t&#365;t-tu-ta-rik ti-ra-hah</i>&mdash;I saw many buffalo,&rdquo;
and we shouted back to him, &ldquo;<i>T&#363;-ra-heh</i>&mdash;It is good.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At once the women began to take down the lodges
and pack the ponies. Buffalo had been discovered
about fifteen miles to the southwest, and orders had
been issued to move the village to the creek on
which they were feeding, while the men should go on
at once and make the surround. Our teamster, to
whom the Indians had already, from his occupation,
given the name &ldquo;Jackass Chief,&rdquo; was directed to
move with the camp; and leaving everything save
guns and ammunition belts in the wagons, we joined
the crowd of men who were riding out of the village.</p>

<p>The scene that we now beheld was such as might
have been witnessed here a hundred years ago. It
is one that can never be seen again. Here were
eight hundred warriors, stark naked, and mounted
on naked animals. A strip of rawhide, or a
lariat, knotted about the lower jaw, was all their
horses&rsquo; furniture. Among all these men there was
not a gun nor a pistol, nor any indication that they
had ever met with the white men. For the moment
they had put aside whatever they had learned of
civilization. Their bows and arrows they held in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>296]</a></span>
their hands. Armed with these ancestral weapons,
they had become once more the simple children of
the plains, about to slay the wild cattle that <i>Ti-ra&acute;-wa</i>
had given them for food. Here was barbarism pure
and simple. Here was nature.</p>

<p>A brief halt was made on the upper prairie, until
all the riders had come up, and then, at a moderate
gallop, we set off. A few yards in advance rode the
twenty-four soldiers, at first curbing in their spirited
little steeds, till the horses&rsquo; chins almost touched
their chests, and occasionally, by a simple motion of
the hand, waving back some impetuous boy, who
pressed too close upon them. Many of the Indians
led a spare horse, still riding the one that had carried
them through the day. Often two men would
be seen mounted on the same animal, the one behind
having the lariats of two led horses wound about his
arm. Here and there a man, with his arm over the
horse&rsquo;s neck, would run along on foot by the side of
the animal which was to serve him in the charge.</p>

<p>As we proceeded, the pace became gradually a
little more rapid. The horses went along easily and
without effort. Each naked Indian seemed a part of
his steed, and rose and fell with it in the rhythmic
swing of its stride. The plain was peopled with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>297]</a></span>
Centaurs. Out over each horse&rsquo;s croup floated the long
black hair of his rider, spread out on the wings of
the breeze. Gradually the slow gallop became a fast
one. The flanks of the horses showed here and there
patches of wet, which glistened in the slanting rays
of the westering sun. Eight, ten, a dozen miles had
been left behind us, and we were approaching the
top of a high bluff, when the signal was given to halt.
In a moment every man was off his horse, but not a
pony of them all showed any sign of distress, nor
gave any evidence of the work he had done, except
by his wet flanks and his slightly accelerated breathing.
Two or three of the soldiers rode up nearly to
the top of the hill, dismounted and then peered over,
and a moment later, at another signal, all mounted
and the swift gallop began again. Over the ridge
we passed, down the smooth slope, and across a wide
level plain, where the prairie dogs and the owls and
the rattlesnakes had their home. Through the dog
town we hurried on thundering hoofs, no doubt amazing
the dogs, and perhaps even arousing some slight
interest in the sluggish, stupid snakes. Bad places
these to ride through at such a pace, for a little carelessness
on your horse&rsquo;s part might cost him a broken
leg and you an ugly tumble. But no one took much
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>298]</a></span>
thought of dog town or horse or possible accident,
for the minds of all were upon the next high ridge,
behind which we felt sure that the buffalo would be
found.</p>

<p>And so it proved. Just before reaching it we were
again halted. Two of the soldiers reconnoitered,
and then signaled that the buffalo were in sight. The
tired horses were now turned loose and the extra
ones mounted. As we rode slowly up over the ridge,
we saw spread out before us a wide valley black with
buffalo. Two miles away, on the other side, rose
steep ragged bluffs, up which the clumsy buffalo
would make but slow progress, while the ponies
could run there nearly as fast as on level ground. It
was the very place that would have been chosen for
a surround.</p>

<p>At least a thousand buffalo were lying down in the
midst of this amphitheater. Here and there, away
from the main herd on the lower hills, were old bulls,
singly and by twos and threes, some of them quietly
chewing the cud, others sullenly pawing up the dust,
or grinding their battered horns into the yellow dirt
of the hillsides. Not the slightest notice was taken
of us as we rode down the slope at a pace that was
almost a run, but still held in check by the soldiers.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>299]</a></span>
The orders for the charge had not yet been given.
Our line was now much more extended than it had
been; each man pressing as far forward as he dared,
and those on either flank being so far ahead of the
center that they were almost on a line with the soldiers.
We had covered perhaps half the distance
between the hilltop and the buffalo, when some of
the outlying bulls seemed to observe us, and after
looking for a moment or two, these started in rapid
flight. This attracted the attention of the herd, and
when we were yet half a mile from them, they took
the alarm. At once all were on their feet. For a
moment they gazed bewildered at the dark line that
was sweeping toward them, and then, down went
every huge head and up flew every little tail, and the
herd was off in a headlong stampede for the opposite
hills. As they sprang to their feet, the oldest man
of the soldiers, who was riding in the center of the
line, turned back toward us, and uttered a shrill
<i>Loo&acute;-ah!</i> It was the word we had waited for.</p>

<p>Like an arrow from a bow each horse darted forward.
Now all restraint was removed, and each man
might do his best. What had been only a wild
gallop became a mad race. Each rider hoped to be
the first to reach the top of the opposite ridge, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>300]</a></span>
to turn the buffalo back into the valley, so that the
surround might be completely successful. How
swift those little ponies were, and how admirably
the Indians managed to get out of them all their
speed! I had not gone much more than half-way
across the valley when I saw the leading Indians pass
the head of the herd, and begin to turn the buffalo.
This was the first object of the chase, for in a stampede,
the cows and young are always in the lead, the
bulls bringing up the rear. This position is not
taken from chivalric motives on the part of the males,
but simply because they cannot run so fast as their
wives and children. Bulls are never killed when
cows and heifers can be had.</p>

<p>Back came the herd, and I soon found myself in
the midst of a throng of buffalo, horses and Indians.
There was no yelling nor shouting on the part of the
men, but their stern set faces, and the fierce gleam of
their eyes, told of the fires of excitement that were
burning within them. Three or four times my rifle
spoke out, and to some purpose; and one shot,
placed too far back, drew on me a quick savage
charge from a vicious young cow. My pony, while
a good cattle horse, was new at buffalo running, and
his deliberation in the matter of dodging caused me
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>301]</a></span>
an anxious second or two, as I saw the cow&rsquo;s head
sweep close to his flank. It was far more interesting
to watch the scene than to take part in it, and I
soon rode to a little knoll from which I could
overlook the whole plain. Many brown bodies lay
stretched upon the ground, and many more were
dashing here and there, closely attended by relentless
pursuers. It was sad to see so much death, but
the people must have food, and none of this meat
would be wasted.</p>

<p>Before I turned my horse&rsquo;s head toward the camp,
the broad disk of the setting sun had rested on the
tops of the western bluffs, and tipped their crests
with fire. His horizontal beams lit up with a picturesque
redness the dusky forms which moved
about over the valley. Up the ravines and over the
hills were stringing long lines of squaws, leading
patient ponies, whose backs were piled high with
dark dripping meat, and with soft shaggy skins.
Late into the night the work continued and the
loads kept coming into the camp. About the flickering
fires in and before the lodges there was feasting
and merriment. Marrow bones were tossed among
the red embers, calf&rsquo;s head was baked in the hot
earth, fat ribs were roasted, <i>ka&acute;wis</i> boiled, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>302]</a></span>
<i>boudins</i> eaten raw. With laughter and singing and
story telling and dance the night wore away.</p>

<p>Over the plain where the buffalo had fallen, the
gray wolf was prowling, and, with the coyote, the
fox and the badger, tore at the bones of the slain.
When day came, the golden eagle and the buzzard
perched upon the naked red skeletons, and took their
toll. And far away to the southward, a few frightened
buffalo, some of which had arrows sticking in
their sore sides, were cropping the short grass of the
prairie.</p>

<h4><a name="notes_3_1" id="notes_3_1"></a>I. ENEMIES AND METHODS OF WARFARE.</h4>

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE Pawnees were a race of warriors. War
was their pleasure and their business. By
war they gained credit, respect, fame. By war they
acquired wealth.</p>

<p>On their long journey from their primitive home
in the far southwest, they must have met, fought
with and conquered many tribes. By conquest&mdash;so
says tradition&mdash;they obtained their first horses, captured
no one knows how long ago, in an attack on a
Cheyenne village.</p>

<p>They were brave men, but brave after their own
peculiar fashion. Their courage was not displayed
in the same way as that of the white man. They
thought it folly to expose themselves unnecessarily.
An enemy was to be surprised, and killed, while
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>304]</a></span>
asleep if possible, or shot through by an arrow from
behind. To meet him in what we call fair fight,
when there was a chance to kill him from an ambush,
would have seemed an insane or desperate
proceeding. And yet, as has been shown by some
of the stories already narrated, they often faced
death with a calmness and an indifference which indicated
the highest physical courage.</p>

<p>It has been very well said that the purpose of the
Indian in his warfare was to inflict the greatest
amount of injury on his enemy with the least possible
risk to himself.</p>

<p>In the old time wars, the participants exercised
the greatest prudence and caution. They took no
risks, where risks could be avoided. It was more
glorious for a war party to kill a single enemy without
receiving a wound, than to kill a dozen, if thereby
they lost a man. The warrior, who led out a war
party, and brought it back without loss, received
credit. His skill as a leader was praised, and his
influence grew. A leader, who lost men, lost also
prestige; the chiefs withdrew their confidence from
him, the young men might decline after that to join
his party.</p>

<p>When the Pawnees came into the northern
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>305]</a></span>
country they found it occupied by the Poncas, the
Omahas and the Otoes. According to their custom,
they attacked these tribes, and, after a resistance
more or less prolonged, conquered them. The Poncas
appear to have made the most stubborn fight
against the invaders, and it is related that they made
an alliance with the Sioux against their common
enemy. From time to time there would be a cessation
of hostilities, and peace would be made, but this
never endured long.</p>

<p>There still exists among the Pawnees a triumph
song, composed after a treacherous attack on the
Pawnees by the Poncas during a time of peace. Mr.
Dunbar&rsquo;s remarks on this song are so interesting
that I quote them in full. He says, &ldquo;The Pawnee
has a song, constituting the finest satirical production
in the language, relating to an attempt that the
Poncas are said to have once made to recover their
independence. Their warriors in a body, so the
account states, made a pretended visit of peace to
the village of Chau-i, at that time the head band
of the Pawnees. After lulling to rest, as they supposed,
the suspicions of the Chau-i, according to a
preconcerted plan, they made an attack on them, but
were signally discomfited. In commemoration of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>306]</a></span>
the victory then achieved, the Pawnees composed
this song, and the presumption is that such a remarkable
production would not have originated and
maintained its position permanently in their minds
without a good historic basis.&rdquo; This is the song:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li-hit!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ku&acute;s-ke-har-u,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;K&#365;r-&#365;-u-ras</i>,<br />
Aha, you Ponca!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was (pretended) peace.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you find<br />
<br />
<i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;id-i, t&#365;s-ku-ra-w&#365;sk-u?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;La&#365;-i-l&#365;k-u-ru-t&#365;s</i>.<br />
What you were laughing at me about?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You meant fight.</p>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;The keen satire of the interrogation is exquisite.
It conceives of the Poncas as quietly laughing in
their sleeves, during their ostensibly amicable visit,
in anticipation of the summary retribution that they
expected to inflict upon their oppressors.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At last the Poncas, Omahas and Otoes were
effectively subjugated, and were permitted to live on
the borders of the Pawnee territory, and under the
quasi-protection of that tribe.</p>

<p>In the old days before the coming of the whites the
Pawnees had no enemies near at hand. They had
conquered all surrounding nations, and claimed and
held the country from the Missouri River to the
Rocky Mountains, and from the Niobrara, south to
the Arkansas River or to the Canadian. Then, when
they wished to go to war, they were forced to journey
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>307]</a></span>
either to the Rocky Mountains to fight the Utes, or
up the Missouri to attack the Crows, or down into
Mexico to plunder the Spaniards, or into Texas to
steal horses from the Comanches, the Wichitas and
other southern tribes. Then the war parties were
great bodies&mdash;sometimes one thousand men&mdash;and all
on foot. Afterward, as settlements approached them
and other tribes were driven into their country, and
the different Pawnee bands were crowded together,
their campaigns diminished in importance, the war
parties became smaller and smaller, until at last only
half a dozen men would start out, and sometimes a
single individual would go off by himself to steal
horses.</p>

<p>The Pawnees were true Ishmaelites. They had no
friends upon the prairies save those whom they had
conquered and held by fear. Foes swarmed about
them. To the north were the different bands of the
Dakotas and the Crows; to the west the Utes, with
the Arapahoes, the Kiowas and the Cheyennes; and
to the south the Comanches, Cheyennes, Kiowas,
Kansas, Osages, and their relations the Wichitas.
With these last they were long at war; for the Pawnees
and Wichitas had forgotten each other&rsquo;s existence,
or rather each tribe was wholly ignorant as to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>308]</a></span>
what had become of the other. Only a tradition of
the old relationship still remained. The kinship was
rediscovered within the last thirty years, when some
Kaws came north on a visit to the Pawnee village,
and brought with them a Wichita, who had been
visiting at the Kaw agency. The Pawnees found
that this man spoke a language nearly like their own,
and at length discovered that the Wichitas were a
part of their own people. Attempts were made to
establish a peace, and to renew their old friendly relations,
but the fact that the Wichitas were so closely
allied to the Comanches, Kiowas and Cheyennes
made it very difficult for the tribes to come together
on a friendly footing. Hostilities still continued
therefore, nor was a lasting peace made until the
visit of <i>Wi-ti-ti le-shar&acute;-uspi</i>, already described.</p>

<p>As a result of this well nigh universal hostility, the
Pawnees were constantly being attacked, and were
constantly losing men, women and children. Mr.
Dunbar, who has taken pains to collect some facts
bearing on this point, says:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Probably, not a year in this century has been
without losses from this source (warfare), though
only occasionally have they been marked with considerable
disasters. In 1832 the Skidi band suffered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>309]</a></span>
a severe defeat on the Arkansas from the Comanches.
In 1847 a Dakota war party, numbering over
seven hundred, attacked a village occupied by two
hundred and sixteen Pawnees, and succeeded in
killing eighty-three. In 1854 a party of one hundred
and thirteen were cut off by an overwhelming body
of Cheyennes and Kiowas, and killed almost to a
man. In 1873 a hunting party of about four hundred,
two hundred and thirteen of whom were men,
on the Republican, while in the act of killing a herd
of buffalo, were attacked by nearly six hundred
Dakota warriors, and eighty-six were killed. But
the usual policy of their enemies has been to cut off
individual or small scattered parties, while engaged
in the chase or in tilling isolated corn patches.
Losses of this kind, trifling when taken singly, have
in the aggregate borne heavily on the tribe. It
would seem that such losses, annually recurring,
should have taught them to be more on their guard.
But let it be remembered that the struggle has not
been in one direction against one enemy. The
Dakotas, Crows, Kiowas, Cheyennes, Arapahoes,
Comanches, Osages and Kansas have faithfully
aided each other, though undesignedly in the main,
in this crusade of extermination against the Pawnee.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>310]</a></span>
It has been in the most emphatic sense, a struggle
of the one against the many. With the possible exception
of the Dakotas, there is much reason to
believe that the animosity of these tribes has been
exacerbated by the galling tradition of disastrous
defeats which Pawnee prowess had inflicted upon
themselves in past generations. To them the last
seventy years have been a carnival of revenge.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Dunbar regards the constant warfare against
their many enemies as one principal cause of the
rapid diminution in numbers of the Pawnees, and,
no doubt, it was a cause; but a far more important
one was the sapping of the tribe&rsquo;s vitality by contact
with the whites. Their villages lay almost directly
in the path of trans-continental emigration, and it
was the introduction of spirits and the special
diseases contracted from the whites which weakened
the tribe, and made the tough and sinewy Pawnee a
ready prey to sickness and death.</p>

<p>Although so ferocious to people of their own color,
the Pawnees have ever been at peace with the whites.
Bad men among them have, no doubt, sometimes
stolen horses, but the tribe has never carried on
an organized war against the Government. While
they have often been provoked by wanton outrages
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>311]</a></span>
inflicted on them, yet they have always borne themselves
peaceably and mildly, and sought redress by
legal or persuasive, rather than by hostile measures.</p>

<p>There is one instance on record which, while it
shows their ferocity, exemplifies also their natural
justice, and deserves to be repeated. This is the
story of the Rawhide.</p>

<p>In the year 1852, among a small party of emigrants,
who were crossing the plains on their way to California,
was a man who had frequently asserted that
he would kill the first Indian he saw. While the
train was camped on a small creek flowing into the
Elkhorn, a young squaw was seen, who belonged to
the neighboring Pita-hau-erat village. Some accounts
say that she came to the camp to beg, others,
that she was going to the stream for a bucket of
water. At all events, she was seen by the emigrants,
who bantered the young man to carry out his boast
that he would kill the first Indian he saw. He shot
and killed the woman. The train moved on during
the night. On the following day the tribe learned
of this wanton butchery. They pursued the train,
and surrounding it, demanded the murderer. He
was at once given up, and a council was held, at
which his fate was decided. The train was ordered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>312]</a></span>
back to the scene of the murder, and there, in the
presence of his horrified companions, the Pawnees
proceeded to flay the murderer alive. After this had
been done, the emigrants were permitted to proceed
on their journey. The stream on whose banks this
act of grim justice took place is still known as Rawhide
Creek.</p>

<p>Not only have the Pawnees never been at war
with the whites, but, for the past twenty-five years,
they have been their allies in every serious Indian
war which has taken place east of the Rocky Mountains.</p>

<p>The Pawnee was taught to deal in ambuscades and
surprises, yet he could fight in the open, too, if necessity
demanded. Sometimes they had pitched battles
with their foes, but their weapons were very primitive,
and such combats were&mdash;in view of the numbers
engaged on either side&mdash;comparatively bloodless.
Between the years 1860 and 1870 such battles frequently
took place near the Pawnee village, when the
Sioux, who were far more numerous than the Pawnees,
would come down from the north to try to
destroy the village. Many a time I have heard from
the lips of grizzled warriors the stories of these battles.
Sometimes the enemy would come down in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>313]</a></span>
small parties, and steal horses, or kill squaws who
were working in the corn patches, but at other times
large bodies of warriors would approach the village
without any attempt at concealment.</p>

<p>About sunrise the Sioux would ride up over the
hills in a line fronting toward the village. They
appeared mounted on their best ponies, clad in their
most elaborate war costume, and wearing long war
bonnets of the feathers of the war eagle, which
almost swept the ground as their horses curveted
along to the music of the monotonous but thrilling
war chant. At the instant of their appearance the
Pawnee village would begin to stir like a disturbed
ant hill. The shouts of command by the men, the
piercing calls from women, the alarmed and excited
shrieks of the children, the neighing and heavy hoof-beats
of the horses, the barking and howling of the
dogs, as they were kicked out of the way, made a
very Babel of sounds. The men snatched their arms,
and springing on their horses rode out on to the
plain to meet the enemy, while the women and children,
after the horses had been secured, mounted to
the tops of the dirt lodges to watch the fight. The
Sioux, when they had come into full view, stopped,
and sat there on their horses, proud of their brave
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>314]</a></span>
attire, and courting admiration. The Pawnees, too,
if time permitted, would don their finest war dresses,
though often they fought naked, and elaborately paint
themselves and their horses. As the Pawnees rode
toward their enemy, the Sioux slowly advanced
toward them, both with extended front. Each party
chanted its songs of war, and uttered yells of defiance.
While they were still six or seven hundred
yards apart they halted, and stood facing each other.
After a short wait, a warrior from one side or the
other rode out before the line and addressed his
party. He opened his speech with some remarks
derogatory to the foe, and in praise of his own people.
From these generalities, he passed to a consideration
of his own excellent qualities, told of what
he had done in the past, and what he now intended
doing, and when he had finished speaking, he bent
low over his horse&rsquo;s neck, and rode furiously toward
one end of the enemy&rsquo;s line. When he had come
within easy bowshot, he usually turned his horse&rsquo;s
head, and rode as hard as he could down along the
line, leaning down, half hidden by his horse, and discharging
arrow after arrow at the enemy. They also
shot at him, as he flew by, and as he rode along,
those whom he had passed dashed out in pursuit,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>315]</a></span>
until the whole party were riding after him as hard
as they could go. If he passed along the line without
injury, he turned his horse toward his own party,
and rode back, his pursuers following him but a
short distance. If, however, he was wounded by the
arrows shot at him, and fell from his horse, or if his
horse was hit and disabled, or if, on account of the
greater speed of their ponies, it seemed likely that
the enemy would overtake him, the whole body of
his tribe made a headlong charge to rescue and
bring him off. The enemy were as eager to take his
scalp as his own people were to save it, and the
opposing warriors came together in a hot melee.</p>

<p>There was little twanging of bow strings, and not
much thrusting of lances; for the most part the
fighting was at quarters too close for this, and the
combatants pounded at each other&rsquo;s heads with
hatchets, war clubs, whip handles, bows and <i>coup</i>
sticks. Bruises were given and received, sometimes
a few men were gashed with hatchets and lances,
and occasionally a man was killed. If the man about
whom the struggle was taking place was scalped, his
party at once drew off, leaving his body, which had
now ceased to have any interest for them, in the
hands of the enemy. If, however, he escaped scalping,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>316]</a></span>
his friends and foes soon separated and withdrew
to their former positions. Then, after a
breathing spell, a man of the other party rode forward,
and made his speech, and the charge and
general attack might be repeated.</p>

<p>Occasionally a very daring or desperate man, instead
of riding down the opposing line, would charge
through it, and as he reached it would let fly an
arrow at some particular man, and count <i>coup</i> on, and
scalp him as he dashed by. He would at once be
surrounded by foes, who did their best to kill him,
while his own tribesmen would charge upon them,
and for a short time the struggle would be very
fierce. A brave man, killed and scalped, was mutilated
in all conceivable ways by the enemy, and was
often cut up into small pieces.</p>

<p>In this way the battle might go on for the greater
part of a day with varying fortunes, but without the
loss on either side of more than a man or two, until
at last one party or the other would become discouraged,
and would break and run.</p>

<p>The Sioux in their attacks on the Pawnee village
were never the victors. They were always defeated
and driven back, and often, in the pursuit, two or
three times as many men were killed as in the actual
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>317]</a></span>
battle. It was but natural that the Pawnees should
have been successful in this defense of their village,
for in such fights they felt that they must conquer.
Defeat to them there meant the loss of all that they
possessed, the slaughter of their women and children,
and the destruction of their village. Besides, if
defeated, they had no place to retreat to. They
would fight to the death.</p>

<p>Their fierce courage and their fighting qualities
were well shown on one famous occasion. The
tribe had gone off south on the buffalo hunt, and
there were left in the village only some of the sick,
the old men, and a few boys, women and children.
Among the sick who remained was <i>Ska-di&acute;ks</i> (Crooked
Hand), a Skidi brave, recognized as a leader in battle,
and one of the bravest warriors in the tribe. The
Sioux had learned of the departure of the Pawnees
with all the fighting men, and had planned to come
down, kill all the people left at home, and destroy
the village.</p>

<p>One morning, to the dismay of those who had
been left behind, six hundred of the very best of the
Sioux warriors rode slowly into view over the hills,
and down on to the plain above the village. They
made no charge, for it was unnecessary to hurry
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>318]</a></span>
about killing the few women, the old men and the
sick who were to be their unresisting victims. They
wished to prolong the agony of these wretched Pawnees,
whose scalps were already theirs, and whose
village would soon be only a few heaps of smoking
ruins. As they rode slowly down the hill there was
no clink of steel nor rattle of harness, only the soft
rustling of the prairie grass under the unshod hoofs
of their spirited war ponies, but this sound was
drowned by the ominous music of their triumphant
war song, which, now loud, now low, was faintly
borne on the breeze to the fated village. Very
deliberately they came on, singing as they marched,
proudly, like conquerors, while the sun glittered on
polished lance-head and gleaming hair plate, and the
wind blew out the fringes of their white war shirts,
or gaily tossed the streaming plumes of their superb
war bonnets.</p>

<p>The news of their appearance was brought to
Crooked Hand, where he lay sick in his lodge. At
once he threw aside the robe in which he was
wrapped, and as he rose to his feet, he cast away
from him by the same motion his sickness. His
orders were quickly issued, and as promptly obeyed.
The village must fight. Tottering old men, whose
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>319]</a></span>
sinews were now too feeble to bend the bow, seized
their long disused arms and clambered on their
horses. Boys too young to hunt, whose bodies had
never been toughened by the long journeys of the
warpath, whose hearts had not been made strong by
the first fast, grasped the weapons that they had as
yet used only on rabbits and ground squirrels, flung
themselves on their ponies, and rode with the old
men. Even squaws, taking what weapons they could&mdash;axes,
hoes, mauls, pestles&mdash;mounted horses, and
marshaled themselves for battle.</p>

<p>The force for the defense numbered two hundred;
superannuated old men, boys and women. Among
them all were not, perhaps, ten active warriors, and
these had just risen from sick beds to take their
place in the line of battle. But then this little
force had a leader. Crooked Hand, mounted on a
superb war pony, was as cool and unconcerned as if
he were about to ride out to a band of buffalo,
instead of leading a force of old men and children
against six hundred of the best warriors that the
Sioux could muster.</p>

<p>At that time the Pawnee village was encompassed
by a high sod wall, and some of Crooked Hand&rsquo;s
people wished to await the charge of the Sioux
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>320]</a></span>
behind this shelter, but their leader would not permit
this. He said to them, &ldquo;We can conquer the
Sioux anywhere.&rdquo; So <i>Ska-di&acute;ks</i> led his forces out to
meet the attack in fair open combat on the plain, on
the same ground where so many times the Pawnees
had routed their enemies. As the Pawnees passed
out of the village on to the plain, the Sioux saw for
the first time the force they had to meet. They
laughed in derision, calling out bitter jibes, and telling
what they would do when they had made the
charge; and, as Crooked Hand heard their laughter,
he smiled, too, but not mirthfully. He knew what
perhaps the Sioux had forgotten, that his people
were single-minded, and that they would fight until
they died. Their strokes would be for their homes
and lives.</p>

<p>The battle began. It seemed like an unequal
fight. Surely one charge would be enough to overthrow
this motley Pawnee throng, who had ventured
out to try to oppose the triumphal march of the
Sioux. But it was not ended so quickly. The fight
began about the middle of the morning, and, to the
amazement of the Sioux, these old men with shrunken
shanks and piping voices, these children with their
small white teeth and soft round limbs, these women
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>321]</a></span>
clad in skirts, and armed with hoes, held the invaders
where they were; they could make no advance. A
little latter it became evident that the Pawnees were
driving the Sioux back. Presently this backward
movement became a retreat, the retreat a rout, the
rout a wild panic. Then, indeed, the Pawnees made
a great killing of their enemies. Many an old man,
whose feeble legs had long refused to bear him on
the warpath, again quavered his war cry, again
counted <i>coup</i> upon his enemy. Many a boy, who had
never shed the blood of any creature larger than a
prairie chicken, that day struck his enemy, and with
shrill childish voice shouted his whoop of triumph,
as he tore away the reeking scalp. More than one
woman, used only to pounding corn and dressing
robes, that day counted her <i>coup</i>, and when the tribe
returned, told what she had done, and changed her
name like a warrior.</p>

<p>To the Pawnees that day was like the day of
Thermopyl&aelig; to the Greeks.</p>

<p>Crooked Hand, pre&euml;minent among the heroes of
that fight, with his own hand killed six of the Sioux,
and had three horses shot under him. His wounds
were many, but he laughed at them. He was content;
he had saved the village.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>322]</a></span>
The same indomitable spirit here shown has characterized
the Pawnees always. For generations
they fought as their fathers had fought, in their own
way, with their native enemies, but when they were
enlisted in the Government service, and trained in
the white man&rsquo;s ways of war, they adapted themselves
readily to their new conditions.</p>

<p>A body of men braver than the Pawnee Scouts,
under Major Frank North and his brother Luther,
never rode on horses. They were far better than
any white soldiers that ever fought on the plains; for,
besides their natural courage, they had at their
finger ends all the wonderful wisdom of the savage.
They could tell, as it seemed by instinct, where a
trail would lead, where the enemy that they were
pursuing would camp, what were his plans. They
had the endurance of their prototype, the wolf. No
labor was too severe, no journey too long, if its end
was a battle with their foes. Their courage, their
discipline, their knowledge of the plains, their acquaintance
with the habits of their enemies, their
endurance, made them superb soldiers; but, perhaps,
more than all this, and yet a part of all this, was the
absorbing devotion and trust which they felt for
<i>Pa&acute;-ni Le-shar</i>, their white leader. Through all the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>323]</a></span>
years that they followed him, he never led them but
to victory; through all these years he never lost a
man in battle, and the belief of the Pawnees in his
ability and his success was like the devotion felt by
the <i>Grande Arm&eacute;e</i> for Napoleon.</p>


<h4><a name="notes_3_2" id="notes_3_2"></a>II. PA&acute;-NI LE-SHAR AND HIS SCOUTS.</h4>

<p>No account of the Pawnees&rsquo; warfare would give
any just impression of their prowess if it omitted
to mention <i>Pa&acute;-ni Le-shar</i> and the forces which he
commanded. The Pawnee Scouts, under the gallant
and able leadership of Frank North, did splendid
service against hostile Indians. They saved
hundreds of lives and millions of dollars&rsquo; worth of
property, and in their campaigns wiped out in blood
the memory of many an injury done to their race by
the Sioux, the Cheyennes, the Arapahoes and the
Kiowas.</p>

<p>Frank North was born in Ohio, March 10, 1840.
When about fifteen years of age he accompanied his
family westward to Council Bluffs, and a little later
across the Missouri River into Nebraska. At about
this time, his father, who was a surveyor, was lost in
a snow storm, and the responsibility of caring for his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>324]</a></span>
family fell in large measure on the boy. Soon after
this he obtained employment as clerk in the trader&rsquo;s
store at the Pawnee agency, and thus made the acquaintance
of the tribe. His strong character early
brought him to the notice of their principal men, and
almost before attaining manhood he had become a
person of influence in the councils of the Pawnee
Nation.</p>

<p>In the year 1864 Frank North was authorized to
enlist a company of Pawnee scouts to be employed
against the bands of hostile Indians, whose depredations
were at that time becoming very troublesome.
The command was organized that autumn, and did
some service along the old emigrant trail. It was not
until the summer of 1865, however, that it saw any
serious fighting. In that year General Connor of
California commanded a large expedition to the
Powder River country, and the Pawnee scouts accompanied
him and rendered brilliant service.</p>

<p>Later, during the building of the Union Pacific
Railway, the depredations of the hostile Sioux, Cheyennes
and Arapahoes became so serious along the
line of the road that the Government authorized
Mr. North to enlist a battalion of scouts from the
Pawnee Nation, and offered him the command with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>325]</a></span>
the rank of major. Several companies of these
scouts were so enlisted, and for years the battalion
did good service on the plains and in the mountains
in Nebraska, Kansas and Wyoming, serving under
Generals Auger, Emory, Carr, Royal, Mackenzie and
Crook, some of the most successful Indian fighters in
that Department. The Pawnee scouts were everywhere,
and at all times brave men, good soldiers and
victorious warriors. The amount of property saved
to the Government, the settlers and the railroad
through the efforts of Major North&rsquo;s command can
scarcely be computed. In all his service of almost
constant fighting, extending over a period of more
than ten years, he never lost a man on the battle
field, and this caused him to be regarded by the
Pawnees as divinely favored.</p>

<p>It is impossible within the limits of a few pages to
give even a sketch of the services performed by
Frank North and his scouts. Two or three isolated
episodes in his career will show something of the
constant danger and hardship of the life he led, and
of the courage, coolness and determination of the
leader and his men.</p>

<p>Such an episode, memorable alike for its danger,
the completeness of the victory gained, and the fact
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>326]</a></span>
that it won for him the title by which he was ever
after known among the Pawnees, marked his first
campaign. It was in the Powder River country, and
Captain North had started with a detachment of his
scouts in pursuit of a party of Indians, whose trail he
had found. For some weeks his men had been hard
worked; and at this time their horses were so jaded
that although they had come within sight of the
Cheyennes, they were unable to overtake them and
force them to a fight. Captain North, who was
mounted on a fresh horse, rode far ahead of his men,
who were constantly falling further and further
behind. At length, realizing the futility of continuing
the pursuit, North dismounted, fired a parting
shot at the Indians, and was about to ride back
toward camp, when the fleeing Cheyennes, about
twenty-five in number, turned and charged him. He
then discovered that he had outridden all his men.
Not one of them was in sight. Hastily dismounting,
he prepared to receive the enemy, and firing as they
advanced killed one. The rest sheered off, and rode
out of rifle shot, and then formed again for another
charge. Feeling for a cartridge to reload his rifle,
North made the startling discovery that he had but
three left, all the others having been lost during his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>327]</a></span>
rapid ride. He found, too, that his horse had been
wounded by a ball from the Cheyennes, and was
in no condition for running; indeed, it could not be
ridden. His situation seemed well nigh hopeless,
but he prepared to make the best of it, by retreating on
foot, leading his wounded horse as a shelter, from
behind which to fight. When the Cheyennes charged
him he would face about, raise his gun to his shoulder,
as if about to fire, and the Indians, who had
already tasted the quality of his lead, would drop
down behind their horses, and sheer off, never coming
so close to him as to make it necessary for him
to use one of his precious cartridges. After a long
weary walk of twelve or fifteen miles, during which
his moccasin-shod feet were cruelly lacerated by the
thorns of the cactus, over which he walked, his pursuers
left him, and he reached his command in
safety. No sooner had he arrived at the camp than,
taking a fresh horse and ordering out a well-mounted
detachment of his men, he set out in pursuit of the
enemy. All that afternoon they rode hard, and
when night fell, dismounting a couple of Pawnees to
follow the trail on foot, the pursuit was still kept up.
Just after daylight, as they rode out into a little
park in the mountains, a tiny column of blue smoke
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>328]</a></span>
rising from a clump of cottonwood trees showed
where the hostiles were camped. The Pawnees rode
steadily forward in double file in military fashion;
and the Cheyennes, supposing that they were white
soldiers, jumped on their horses and rode out on to
the open hillside where they formed a line of battle
to meet the enemy. The Pawnees rode quietly onward
until they were quite near the Cheyennes, and
then loud and clear their ringing war whoop broke
out upon the morning air. When the Cheyennes
heard this war-cry, which told them that the attacking
party were Pawnees, their hearts became like
water, and they turned and fled. Already, however,
seven of their number had fallen before the Pawnee
bullets, and the fresher horses of the Pawnees easily
overtook the tired ones ridden by the pursued. Of
that party of Cheyennes not one escaped, and with
twenty-seven scalps, and all the plunder, the victorious
Pawnees returned that afternoon to their
command.</p>

<p>Among the captured property were thirty-five
horses and mules, some of which had been taken
from a party of fifteen soldiers, killed to a man by
these Cheyennes but a few days before; there were
also the scalps of these soldiers, and wearing apparel
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>329]</a></span>
belonging to white women and children, which justified
the belief that they had recently massacred a
party of emigrants.</p>

<p>It was on the occasion of the scalp dance which
followed this victory, and when the Scouts were
changing their names, as was the custom after a
successful encounter with the enemy, that the Pawnees
gave to Major North the title <i>Pa&acute;-ni Le-shar</i>
(Chief of the Pawnees), a name which has been
borne by only one other white man, General John C.
Fremont, the Pathfinder.</p>

<p>The story of the killing of Tall Bull, and the fight
with Turkey Leg&rsquo;s band of Sioux, illustrate the
readiness and the daring of Major North in battle.
Tall Bull was a chief who commanded a large village
of renegade Sioux and Cheyennes, who had given
great trouble by their depredations. Major North,
with his Pawnees and some white United States
troops, had been looking for this village for some
time, and at length succeeded in surprising it near
Summit Springs. The village was captured in the
charge and many of the hostiles killed. Others fled
or concealed themselves in the ravines and washouts,
which seamed the prairie, and made a desperate
fight. The Pawnees were scattered about in little
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>330]</a></span>
parties, killing the Indians thus concealed, when
Major North and his brother came riding rapidly
along, side by side, over the open prairie. They had
approached within fifty or sixty yards of a narrow
steep-walled ravine, of the existence of which they
were ignorant, when an Indian raised his head above
its side and fired. The ball whistled between the
heads of the two riders; Major North threw up his
hands and reeled in the saddle as if about to fall,
and the Indian&rsquo;s head disappeared from sight.
Springing from his horse, the Major handed his
bridle rein to his brother and directed him to ride
away at a gallop. The tramp of the two horses
sounded more and more faintly on the hard ground,
and the Indian, thinking that the whites were riding
off, raised his head to note the effect of his shot.
North&rsquo;s rifle was already leveled at the spot where
the head had disappeared, and as the black hair came
into view the finger pressed the trigger more and
more closely, and as the eyes appeared above the
ground, a ball pierced the brain of Tall Bull. A hundred
yards up the ravine was found his war pony,
stabbed to the heart, and by it sat his squaw, awaiting
with Indian patience whatever fate might come to
her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>331]</a></span>
During one of the summer hunts, on which Major
North accompanied the Pawnees, they were one day
scattered out over the prairie running buffalo, when
all at once North heard the whistle of rifle balls and
saw the dirt thrown up about his horse by the bullets.
He called to a Pawnee near him to tell those
boys to be more careful about shooting. The Pawnee
looked in the direction from which the balls
were coming, and after an instant called back, &ldquo;They
are Sioux, you had better run.&rdquo; It was a large party
of Sioux under the Chief Turkey Leg.</p>

<p>North and the Pawnee rode for the bluffs near at
hand, and before reaching them were joined by C.&nbsp;D.
Morse, his brother-in-law, and half a dozen Pawnees.
The little party was surrounded by the Sioux
and took refuge in a shallow washout at the head of
a ravine, where they were somewhat sheltered from
the enemy&rsquo;s fire by the sunflower stalks and the low
edges of the bank. Their horses were at once killed,
and the Sioux, who were numerous, became very
bold, charging up to the edge of the washout, and
shooting down into it.</p>

<p>They were led by an Indian, apparently of some
importance, who was conspicuous by a large American
flag which he carried. This man was constantly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>332]</a></span>
exhorting his men, and would lead them part way on
the charge, turning off, however, before coming within
range of the washout, where North and his brother-in-law,
with the seven Pawnees, were lying concealed.
After each charge he would ride to the top
of a hill near at hand, and make a speech to his warriors.
It occurred to Major North that if he could
kill the man who carried the flag the other Sioux
might lose some of their courage. As they were retiring
from a charge, therefore, he crept cautiously
down the ravine, concealed by the long grass which
grew in its bed, until he had come within rifle range
of the hill from which the leader was making his
speech, and by a careful shot killed him and regained
the shelter of the washout without injury.</p>

<p>Disheartened by the fall of their leader, the Sioux
made no further attempt to kill the besieged company,
but after a little desultory long-range firing drew off,
so that North and his little party regained the main
village in safety.</p>

<p>The Pawnee Scouts were last called out in 1876,
when General Mackenzie fought the hostile Cheyennes
in the Powder River country; and, led by Major
North and his brother, they made that famous charge
on the village which inflicted on the hostiles the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>333]</a></span>
crushing blow from which they never recovered.
How <i>Pa&acute;-ni Le-shar</i> held his men under fire that
day, when the bullets were raining on them from the
hillsides, was told in a letter written to me by a participant
in the fight. &ldquo;For cool bravery,&rdquo; it ran, &ldquo;he
beats anything that you ever saw. Why, at one time we
were under such hot fire that even our scouts wanted
to run, and to tell you the truth, I felt sort of that
way myself; but Frank just straightened himself up
on the old black horse and said, very quietly, &lsquo;The
first one of <em>my</em> men that runs I will kill.&rsquo; They
didn&rsquo;t run.&rdquo;</p>

<p>If the full story of Major North&rsquo;s life were written
it would constitute a history of the Indian wars in
Nebraska and Wyoming from 1860 to 1876&mdash;a history
so complete that there would be little left to
add to it. Wherever the hostile Indians were worst
there Frank North was to be found at the head of
his Pawnee Scouts, doing the hardest of the fighting,
and accomplishing work that could have been done
by no other body of men.</p>

<p>From his long service in the army Major North
was known to all officers who have ever been
stationed in the field where his operations were conducted,
and by all of them he was admired and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>334]</a></span>
respected. He was closely connected with the growth
of the State of Nebraska. Several times he represented
Platte county in the Legislature, and the
strength and uprightness of his character won the
confidence of all who knew him. He died at his
home in Columbus, Nebraska, March 14, 1885, aged
forty-five years.</p>

<p>His was a singularly lovable nature. If the
stronger manly points of his character inspired
respect and admiration, not less did his gentleness
and consideration for others win the deepest affection.
He was modest almost to diffidence, and it
was with difficulty that he could be induced to speak
of his own heroic achievements. And yet his face
told the story of the power within the man.</p>

<p>The secret of Major North&rsquo;s success in commanding
the Pawnees, who loved him as much as they
respected him, lay in the unvarying firmness, justice,
patience and kindness with which he treated them.
He never demanded anything unreasonable of them,
but when he gave an order, even though obedience
involved great peril, or appeared to mean certain
death, it was a command that must be carried
out. He was their commander, but at the same
time their brother and friend. Above all, he was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>335]</a></span>
their leader. In going into battle he never said to
them, &ldquo;Go,&rdquo; but always &ldquo;Come on.&rdquo; It is little
wonder, then, that the devotion felt for him by all
the Pawnee Nation, and especially by the men who
had served under him in battle, was as steadfast as it
was touching.</p>


<h4><a name="notes_3_3" id="notes_3_3"></a>III. WAR PARTIES.</h4>

<p>It has already been said that the highest ambition
of the Pawnee young man was to be successful in
war. His whole training, all his surroundings, caused
him to believe that this success was the only thing
worth living for. Life at best he regarded as hard
enough, and only the fame to be acquired by the
performance of brave deeds could sweeten it so as
to make it endurable. To convey a notion of the
way in which these war parties were originated, and
of the manner in which they were led, I give here
stories told me by three brave men who in the old
days led out many war parties. The three stories
were taken down from the lips of the narrators.
Only one who is familiar with scenes in an Indian
camp can conceive how much these stories lose by
being put into cold type. As heard from the lips of
the Indian, they have accessories of surroundings,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>336]</a></span>
voice and gesticulation, which add tremendously to
their vividness and their interest. Your Indian is a
real actor, and in telling a story he throws himself
into his tale, and helps out his vocal speech with a
sign vocabulary which almost tells the whole story
to one who is ignorant of the language.</p>

<p>In the middle of the lodge the fire is burning, and
over it hangs the pot which is ever bubbling. At
the back of the lodge, opposite the doorway, sits the
host, and above him to the lodge poles are tied the
sacred bundles, their buckskin coverings black with
the smoke and wear of years, perhaps of centuries.
To the left of the host are the most important guests,
and the other inmates of the lodge are scattered
about here and there, the women being nearest the
door. The host hands the pipe to some young man,
who carefully fills it, and soon it is passing around
the circle. Then a few remarks are made by the
older men, and some question is asked which starts
discussion. After that comes a pause, and then a
middle-aged warrior begins a story. He is They-know-that-Leader,
and he tells how he took the
horses:</p>

<p>&ldquo;They tell me that my father was a warrior, and
in his time led out many war parties. In my young
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>337]</a></span>
days I went out with war parties as a volunteer many
times.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In my trips with warriors I had closely watched
their ways and movements. I had learned from them
how to shoot and how to travel so as to escape discovery.
I made three trips as leader. I resolved
one time, just as we were setting out on the summer
hunt, that during the hunt I would lead a party off
on the warpath. I made my plans, but I waited first
to make the sacrifice. At that time we did not go
far; we came back to the village because the Sioux
were about us on the hunt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;On a certain day I played all day the stick game
(<i>Satsa-wi-kah-t&#363;sh</i>). In the afternoon I had lost
everything I had. Late in the afternoon I called
a few of the young men to sit down with me. When
they had come and sat down with me, there were
only a few. I said to them, &lsquo;I have called you together
to let you know that I am poor in mind. I
want to find out if <i>Ti-ra&acute;-wa</i> will take pity on me
and help me. I intend that you and I shall go off
somewhere on the warpath. Make your preparations
to start in two days. Get your moccasins filled
with food, get your awls and sinews, your arrows
and your bows.&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>338]</a></span>
&ldquo;On the day I had set, in the night, we went out
from the village, having with us the old man who
had performed the ceremonies of the sacred things
that I was to have with me. On the outskirts of the
village, we stood in a row, and the old man prayed
for our success. Then we were ready to start.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Different war parties had gone out before I
started, but I considered to see if there was not
some way in which I could beat them. I made a
plan by which I got ahead of them. We traveled
fast, and went up to Grand Island to get some arrows&mdash;for
my young men had but few arrows&mdash;and
also to get some provisions. The next morning we
again started, and went as far as we could that day.
At night I performed ceremonies, as I had been
directed. I filled a pipe and smoked to <i>Ti-ra&acute;-wa</i>,
as we have always done. That is the first thing we
have to do. Then I told some of my young men to
build a fire, and others to go off to a distance to
watch.</p>

<p>&ldquo;On a war party some one was always taken along
who could shoot well. This time we had no one
except myself. The next day I killed an antelope,
but I did not sacrifice then, because those are not
animals which we sacrifice. We had been gone three
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>339]</a></span>
nights more before I killed anything more. The
fourth day I killed a buck deer, and I sacrificed it.
From that day on I never killed anything.</p>

<p>&ldquo;After I had been out nine days I stole the horses.
It was not always the same about stealing horses. It
was not always done in the same way. It was daytime
when my scouts discovered that there were
people about; they saw signs of a village. They
told me afterward that they had heard reports of
guns during the day. They had not come back to
tell me of this, but had gone by. I was coming on
behind with the young men, when all at once I heard
the report of a gun. As soon as I heard it I stopped,
and sent two spies out to see what it was, and whether
a camp was near. They wandered about in the timber,
and came back and said that they saw nothing.
I told my men that we would go off to a distance
and wait there during the night. We waited there
until morning, and when the sun got up we heard
the report of guns in different directions, and sometimes
coming toward us. We went to a ca&ntilde;on, and
hid in the plum brush, and ate plums. Of course we
were afraid, but we ate the plums. We thought that
this might be the last time we would ever have any
plums. They were shooting all about us, and seemed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>340]</a></span>
to be coming closer. In the afternoon, the shots
stopped, and they went on to their camp.</p>

<p>&ldquo;While we were hiding here, many of the party
feared that we had been seen. They wanted to start
back as soon as it grew dark, but I deceived them.
I told them that I was very thirsty, and that we
would have to go down to a certain place near the
river, and get a drink of water. After night we
started, and as we were going along, we heard a dog
bark. We stopped and sat down, and I told my
companions that two men, whom I called by name,
were to go and steal horses. &lsquo;But,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;I am
going with them to look after them.&rsquo; I told them to
pull off their leggings and moccasins, because the
brush was dry and caught on them, making a noise.
We went together to a certain place near the village,
and then these young men told me that they had
been there the day before and had been discovered.
Then they turned around and went back to where
the party were hiding, but I went on to the village.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When I came close to the village everything was
still; the people were asleep. Where I entered the
camp, there was a little timber growing, and here I
stopped. While I was considering what I should do,
a girl came out of a lodge, but she went away from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>341]</a></span>
me. If she had come toward me I should have
killed her, for she would have discovered me. After
the girl had entered a lodge, I went into the camp
to where there were some horses. I drove them out
of the camp. Six went back, and I drove nine to
where I had left my party. The two that I had
ordered to steal horses for me were there. When I
came to the place, and found all my men there, I
said to them, &lsquo;This is very good. I have stolen
some horses for you. Now I will go back and get
the rest of them for you.&rsquo; One of the other men
persuaded me not to go again, but to let him go.
He did so, and brought the six other horses.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was the custom, if it was very difficult or dangerous
to go to a place to steal horses, for the leader
himself to go and do the work.</p>

<p>&ldquo;After two nights on the return journey I divided
the horses among the men. It used to be the custom
after a party had been successful and brought back
the horses for them to change their names. After
this trip my name was changed to &lsquo;They-know-that-Leader.&rsquo;
It was the custom among the Pawnees if
they brought in horses to make an offering. We felt
that we owed something to <i>Ti-ra&acute;-wa</i>, and we gave
a horse to the priest, the old man who had performed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>342]</a></span>
the ceremonies. I was gone but thirteen days, and
returned to my tribe.&rdquo;</p>


<p class="break">After him follows <i>A-ka-pa-kish</i>&mdash;Pities-the-Poor.
He, too, tells his story, and explains why one of his
war parties was unsuccessful:</p>

<p>&ldquo;My father told me, if I should ever want to go
off on a war party, to humble myself, and not to let
a day pass without praying to <i>Ti-ra&acute;-wa</i> by my smokes.
I must always remember to pray to <i>Ti-ra&acute;-wa</i> to give
me a strong will, and to encourage and bless me in
my worship to him. Even when I was eating I
must always remember to pray to him. This I must
do for some time before starting out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At one time I felt that I was poor, and I resolved
to go off on the warpath. A warrior, whom I knew,
went out and took a lot of horses. He had been as
poor as I. I believed that this man had got his
horses because he had prayed to <i>Ti-ra&acute;-wa</i>, and I
thought, &lsquo;If I pray to <i>Ti-ra&acute;-wa</i>, why may I not do
the same.&rsquo; So I prayed. No one else knew what
I intended. After I had made up my mind, I
selected another man, one whom I could trust, and
called him to tell him of my resolve. I made him
sit by me in the lodge, and said to him, &lsquo;I want you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>343]</a></span>
to sit by me to-day, and smoke, and learn my intention.&rsquo;
After we had smoked, I said to him, &lsquo;My
friend, I want you to know that we are on the warpath.
We are going out to look for some horses.&rsquo;
After he had smoked, the other man replied, saying,
&lsquo;Brother, it is well. Let us ask <i>Ti-ra&acute;-wa</i> to take
pity on us, to help us on our war trip, and to let
us bring home many horses.&rsquo; We two were the
leaders.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some time after we had talked together, and
made up our minds what we would do, we selected
certain young men that we could depend on, and
told them that we were on the warpath. This was
done in this way. We selected a pipe with which to
have a sacred smoke, filled it and smoked. Then
we called together into the lodge the others, who did
not know our purpose. After they had assembled, I
filled the pipe, and said, &lsquo;We are going on a war
party. We have filled this pipe, and must decide
what is to be done.&rsquo; Then I passed the pipe to the
man who sat next to me. If he wished to join us he
smoked, and passed it to the next man. It was not
allowed for any one to smoke unless he would go
with this party. Some might refuse the pipe, saying,
&lsquo;I have decided to go with another party.&rsquo; The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>344]</a></span>
smoking of the pipe was a promise that the leader
could depend on the man who smoked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They used to have a certain ceremony to follow
before starting out on the warpath. It was something
handed down, a special manner of praying to
<i>Ti-ra&acute;-wa</i> that he would bless them in their warfare.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At last everything was ready for the start. The
young men had their packs made up. They carried
cooked pounded corn, and pounded buffalo meat
mixed with tallow; and sometimes the loads were
heavy. Some would carry ten pairs of moccasins,
each one stuffed full of corn, or pounded buffalo
meat. They were well fed. The loads were so
heavy that at first we would only make short marches.
The leaders had to see that the young men were not
overworked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When all was ready, the priest who performed
the ceremonies met us. He brought with him the
sacred bundle which we were to take with us. At
night when it was all still, after every one was asleep,
the ceremonies were performed. We smoked and worshiped
to the east and west, and to the north and
south, and prayed for success.</p>

<p>&ldquo;On that night we started, and went as far as we
could; and the next day, toward evening, when we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>345]</a></span>
stopped, we dug out a fire-place, like the one in a
lodge, and we two leaders sat by it, facing the east,
while before us were the sacred things. The leader
has to be a good orator, he has to speak to his young
men, and advise them well, encouraging them to be
strong-hearted. He would speak to them and say,
&lsquo;We have but a short time to live, so while we are
on this trip let us determine to be single-minded.
Let us all look to <i>Ti-ra&acute;-wa</i>, who is the ruler over
all things, and ask him to take pity on us, and bless
our warpath. We must respect the animals that the
ruler has made and not kill any of them; no birds,
nor wolves, nor any creeping things.&rsquo; Not a night
passed but that, after we were seated in a circle,
I would talk to the party, and pray, and hope that
<i>Ti-ra&acute;-wa</i> would bless us and take pity on us, and
that we might be the party that would have good
success. On my war parties I had to watch at all
times, even when I was resting, to see that my young
men should, before they slept, pray to <i>Ti-ra&acute;-wa</i>
that they might dream something good, and that it
might come to pass.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The old priest who had performed the ceremonies,
and had let me take the sacred things, had told
me to kill a particular kind of animal, a deer, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>346]</a></span>
sacrifice it. I sent some spies ahead to look over
the country, and a messenger came back from them,
saying that they had seen some animals. He did
not describe them, and I ordered the messenger to
have the hunter kill them. I heard the report of a
gun. The hunter with two shots killed three. They
were antelope. When the hunter came to me he
told me what he had done, and described the animals
which he had killed. They were not the animals
I had been directed to kill for the sacrifice. I hesitated,
for I did not know what to do. I did not
wish to eat these animals before the sacrifice had
been made. To do this is bad. It troubled me. I
was troubled, because if we ate them it would look
as if we cared nothing for <i>Ti-ra&acute;-wa</i>. Finally we
ate what had been killed, and made no sacrifice.
Afterward we killed two more and ate them, and
still made no sacrifice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One night I dreamed that the hunter had shot a
buffalo. It fell, but as we went up to it, it got up
and ran off. We went on for eight days, and had
made no sacrifice to <i>Ti-ra&acute;-wa</i>. One day my scouts
saw a man sitting on a hill. Some of them wanted
to shoot at him, but the others said &lsquo;no.&rsquo; They
came back to tell me about it, and when they had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>347]</a></span>
returned to the place where they had seen him, the
man was gone. The man had seen my spies. Not
far off was a village, and the warriors in it came to
look for us, but we ran away. They hunted for us,
but we had got out of their sight. After this we
came back home.&rdquo;</p>


<p class="break">Curly Chief, second chief of the Kit-ke-hahk&acute;-i
band, is the last, and he tells how he sacrificed a
scalp:</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was in the fall, before the winter buffalo hunt
was made, that I thought I would go on the warpath.
Every little while I would call a few men to
sit down with me, and would tell them that I had it
in mind to go on the warpath.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The people went out on the winter hunt and killed
buffalo, and while they were on their way back to
the village, I started on the warpath with a number
of young men. From the camp we went south to
the Arkansas River. When we reached that river, it
began to snow, and the snow fell six feet deep. We
stopped in one place eleven days, till the snow got
less deep. From there we went on to the sandhills
by the North Canadian. One day as we were going
along, we saw far off three Indians on foot. They
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>348]</a></span>
were Kiowas. Probably they had been on the warpath
and had lost their horses. We attacked and
killed them. They did not fight. We killed them
like women. Then, indeed, we divided the scalps,
and made many of them. From there we started
home, and found the tribe camped on the Solomon
River. When we reached home there was great joy,
and we danced the scalp dance.</p>

Ruler. It is our aim, after we have been helped, to
give thanks.&rdquo;</p>

<h3><a name="religion" id="religion"></a>RELIGION.</h3>


<h4><a name="notes_4_1" id="notes_4_1"></a>I. BELIEFS.</h4>

<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>T is generally believed that, among the Indians of
North America, the priests and the shamans,
&ldquo;medicine men,&rdquo; or doctors, are the same. This is
not the case with the Pawnees. Among them the
priestly office was entirely distinct from that of the
doctor, and had nothing in common with it. The
priest was in a sense the medium of communication
with <i>Ti-ra&acute;-wa</i>; he prayed to the deity more efficaciously
than could a common person, acted, in fact,
as an intercessor; he knew the secrets of the sacred
bundles, and when he asked anything good for the
tribe, or for an individual, it was likely to be granted.
His education and the power given him from above
brought him into specially close relations with
<i>Ti-ra&acute;-wa</i>, who seemed to watch over him and to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>351]</a></span>
listen to him when he interceded for the tribe. He
was an intermediary between <i>Ti-ra&acute;-wa</i> and the
people, and held a relation to the Pawnees and their
deity not unlike that occupied by Moses to Jehovah
and the Israelites.</p>

<p>The office of the &ldquo;medicine man,&rdquo; shaman or doctor,
had to do only with sickness or injury. He was
the healer. Disease was caused by bad spirits, and
it was the doctor&rsquo;s part to drive off these evil influences.</p>

<p>In the lodge or house of every Pawnee of influence,
hanging on the west side, and so opposite the
door, is the sacred bundle neatly wrapped in buckskin,
and black with smoke and age. What these
bundles contain we do not know. Sometimes, from
the ends, protrude bits of scalps, and the tips of
pipe stems and slender sticks, but the whole contents
of the bundle are known only to the priests and to
its owner&mdash;perhaps, not always even to him. The
sacred bundles are kept on the west side of the
lodge, because, being thus furthest from the door,
fewer people will pass by them than if they were
hung in any other part of the lodge. Various superstitions
attach to these bundles. In the lodges where
certain of them are kept it is forbidden to put a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>352]</a></span>
knife in the fire; in others, a knife may not be thrown;
in others, it is not permitted to enter the lodge with
the face painted; or again, a man cannot go in if he
has feathers tied in his head.</p>

<p>On certain sacred occasions the bundles are
opened, and their contents form part of the ceremonial
of worship.</p>

<p>No one knows whence the bundles came. Many
of them are very old; too old even to have a history.
Their origin is lost in the haze of the long ago.
They say, &ldquo;The sacred bundles were given us long
ago. No one knows when they came to us.&rdquo;
Secret Pipe Chief, one of the very oldest men in the
tribe, and its High Priest, said to me:</p>

<p>&ldquo;All the sacred bundles are from the far off country
in the southwest, from which we came long ago.
They were handed down to the people before they
started on their journey. Then they had never seen
anything like iron, but they had discovered how to
make the flint knives and arrow points. There was
nothing that came to us through the whites. It all
came to us through the power of <i>Ti-ra&acute;-wa</i>.
Through his power we were taught how to make
bows and stone knives and arrow heads.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was through the Ruler of the universe that the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>353]</a></span>
sacred bundles were given to us. We look to them,
because, through them and the buffalo and the corn,
we worship <i>Ti-ra&acute;-wa</i>. We all, even the chiefs,
respect the sacred bundles. When a man goes on
the warpath, and has led many scouts and brought
the scalps, he has done it through the sacred bundles.
There were many different ceremonies that
they used to go through. The high priest performs
these ceremonies.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The high priestship was founded in this way:
The black eagle spoke to a person, and said to him,
&lsquo;I am one of those nearest to <i>Ti-ra&acute;-wa</i>, and you
must look to me to be helped; to the birds and the
animals&mdash;look to me, the black eagle, to the white-headed
eagle, to the otter and the buffalo.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The black eagle sent the buzzard as a messenger
to this person, and he gave him the corn. The
secrets of the high priestship and the other secrets
were handed down at the same time. The buzzard,
because he is bald, stands for the old men who have
little hair. The white-headed eagle also represents
the old men, those whose hair is white. These are
the messengers through whom <i>Ti-ra&acute;-wa</i> sends his
words to the people. The Wichitas also had these
secrets, and so have the Rees.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>354]</a></span>
The Pawnees believe that they were created by <i>Ti-ra&acute;-wa</i>,
but that there had been people on the earth
before them. They say, &ldquo;The first men who lived
on the earth were very large Indians. They were
giants; very big and very strong. The animals that
lived then were the same that we know now, and of
the same size. These giants used to hunt the buffalo
on foot. They were so swift and strong that a man
could run down a buffalo, and kill it with a great
stone, or a club, or even with his flint knife. Then,
when he had killed it, if it was a big buffalo bull, he
would tie it up, throw it over his back, and carry it
into camp, just as a man to-day would carry in an
antelope. When one killed a yearling, he would
push its head up under his belt, and let its body
swing by his side, just as we would carry a rabbit.</p>

<p>&ldquo;These people did not believe in <i>Ti-ra&acute;-wa</i>. When
it would thunder and rain, they would shake their
fists at the sky and call out bad words. In these
days all people, wherever they live&mdash;all Indians, all
white men, all Mexicans and all black men&mdash;when
they smoke up, speak to <i>A-ti&acute;-us Ti-ra&acute;-wa</i>, and ask
that he will give them the right kind of a mind,
and that he will bless them, so that they may
have plenty to eat, and may be successful in war,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>355]</a></span>
and may be made chiefs and head men. When
we smoke toward the earth we say, &lsquo;Father of
the dead, you see us.&rsquo; This means that this is
<i>Ti-ra&acute;-wa&rsquo;s</i> ground. It belongs to him, and we ask
him that he will let us walk on it, and will let us
be buried in it. We believe that after we are dead
we will live again with <i>Ti-ra&acute;-wa</i> up in the sky.
We fear nothing after death worse than we know
now. All will live again with <i>Ti-ra&acute;-wa</i> and be
happy. A thief, one who steals from others in the
camp, one who is bad, dies, and that is the end of
him. He goes into the ground, and does not live
again. One reason why we believe that there is a
life after death is that sometimes, when asleep, we
dream and see these things. We see ourselves living
with <i>Ti-ra&acute;-wa</i>. Then, too, we often dream of our
people whom we have known, and who have died.
We dream of being dead ourselves, and of meeting
these people and talking with them, and going to
war with them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, these giants did not believe in any of these
things. They did not pray to <i>Ti-ra&acute;-wa</i>, and they
thought that they were very strong, and that nothing
could overcome them. They grew worse and
worse. At last <i>Ti-ra&acute;-wa</i> got angry, and he made
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>356]</a></span>
the water rise up level with the land, and all the
ground became soft, and these great people sank
down into the mud and were drowned. The great
bones found on the prairie are the bones of these
people, and we have been in deep ca&ntilde;ons, and have
seen big bones under ground, which convinces us
that these people did sink into the soft ground.</p>

<p>&ldquo;After the destruction of the race of giants, <i>Ti-ra&acute;-wa</i>
created a new race of men, small, like those of
to-day. He made first a man and a woman. They
lived on the earth and were good. To them was
given the corn. From this man and this woman the
Pawnees sprung, and they have always cultivated
the corn from the earliest times.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There can be no doubt as to the belief of the
Pawnees in a future life. The spirits of the dead
live after their bodies have become dust. The
stories of the Ghost Bride and the Ghost Wife,
already given, are examples of this belief. Secret
Pipe Chief told me of himself:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was dead once. Just as I died, I found my
way leading to an Indian village. I entered it, and
went straight to the lodge of my friends and my
relations. I saw them, and when I saw them I
knew them again. I even knew my old relations,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>357]</a></span>
whom I had never looked on when I was alive. I
went into a lodge, but I was not offered a seat, and
I thought that I was not welcome. I came out of
the lodge, and went out of the village toward the
west. Then I came back to life again. In the
morning I had died, and I came to life in the afternoon.
That must be the reason that I still live, and
am getting old. I was not welcome yet. They did
not receive me. From this I am convinced that
there is a life after we are dead.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sometimes ghosts appear to them, but more often
they merely speak to them; only a voice is heard.
They believe that the little whirlwinds often seen in
summer are ghosts. The reason for this is that
once a person shot at a whirlwind with his arrow.
The arrow passed through it, and it all disappeared
and came to nothing. Then the man was convinced
that it was a ghost, and that he had killed it.</p>

<p>The different bands of the Pawnees had not all
the same beliefs. Thus the Skidi band offered up
the human sacrifice&mdash;a captive taken in war&mdash;to the
morning star. This is thought to have been a propitiatory
offering to avert the evil influences exerted
by that planet. At the present day the Indians
speak of the sacrifice as having been made to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>358]</a></span>
<i>Ti-ra&acute;-wa</i>. None of the other tribes had this form
of worship, and in this fact we have another indication
that the separation of the Skidi from the Pawnees
had been a long one. The <i>Ka-wa-ra-kish</i>
band of the Pita-hau-erat, are said to have been
&ldquo;the only ones of the Pawnees who did not worship
<i>Ti-ra&acute;-wa</i>. They worshiped toward the west.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mention has been made of the <i>Nahu&acute;rac</i>, or animals,
which possess miraculous attributes given
them by <i>Ti-ra&acute;-wa</i>. The Pawnees know of five
places where these animals meet to hold council&mdash;five
of these <i>Nahu&acute;rac</i> lodges. One of these is at
<i>Pa-h&#365;k&acute;</i>, on the south side of the Platte River, opposite
the town of Fremont, in Nebraska. The
word <i>Pa-h&#365;k&acute;</i> means &ldquo;hill island.&rdquo; Another animal
home is under an island in the Platte River, near
the town of Central City. It is called by the Pawnees
<i>La-la-wa-koh-ti-to</i>, meaning &ldquo;dark island.&rdquo;
The third of these sacred places is on the Loup
Fork, opposite the mouth of the Cedar River, and
under a high, white cut bank. It is called <i>Ah-ka-wit-akol</i>,
&ldquo;white bank.&rdquo; Another is on the Solomon
River, <i>Kitz-a-witz-&#365;k</i>, &ldquo;water on a bank;&rdquo; it is called
<i>Pa&acute;howa</i> sometimes. This is a mound, shaped like
a dirt lodge. At the top of the mound, in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>359]</a></span>
middle, is a round hole, in which, down below, can be
seen water. At certain times, the people gather
there, and throw into this hole their offerings to
<i>Ti-ra&acute;-wa</i>, blankets and robes, blue beads, tobacco,
eagle feathers and moccasins. Sometimes, when
they are gathered there, the water rises to the top of
the hole, and flows out, running down the side of
the mound into the river. Then the mothers take
their little children and sprinkle the water over
them, and pray to <i>Ti-ra&acute;-wa</i> to bless them. The
water running out of the hole often carries with it
the offerings, and the ground is covered with the
old rotten things that have been thrown in. The
fifth place is a hard, smooth, flinty rock, sticking up
out of the ground. They call it <i>Pa-h&#363;r&acute;</i>, &ldquo;hill that
points the way.&rdquo; In the side of the hill there is a
great hole, where the <i>Nahu&acute;rac</i> hold councils.
This hill is in Kansas, and can be seen from the
Burlington &amp; Missouri River Railroad. It is known
to the whites as Guide Rock.</p>

<h4><a name="notes_4_2" id="notes_4_2"></a>II. CEREMONIES.</h4>

<p>To describe satisfactorily any considerable proportion
of the religious ceremonials of the Pawnees,
would require a more extended space than is here at
my command. Several of the special ceremonies,
however, may be mentioned in general terms.</p>

<p>Like some other tribes of the plains Indians, the
Pawnees had a certain special worship at the time of
the first thunder in the spring. This first thunder
warned them that winter was at an end and that the
time of the planting was drawing near.</p>

<p>Of this worship a Chau-i said to me: &ldquo;We all believe
in <i>Ti-ra&acute;-wa</i>. We know that there is a power
above that moves the universe, and that he controls
all things. In the old days when they had buffalo
meat, they used to make a sacrifice at the time of
the first thunder in the spring. The next day after
it had thundered, all the people would go into the
sacred lodge, where the sacred bundles were kept at
that time. When they had all come together, the
priest would open the bundles and take out the
sacred things, among which were Indian tobacco and
some little pieces of scalp tied to a stick. Through
these sacred things we worshiped, and the sacrifices
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>361]</a></span>
were made to the Ruler above. This seemed to be
a help to us, and we used to live, increase and grow
strong. Up north, when we worshiped at the time
of the first thunder, we never had cyclones. Down
here, now that this worship has been given up, we
have them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There is no doubt that the most important of the
religious ceremonials of the Pawnees were the burnt
offering of the animal and of the scalp. These two,
though different, had yet the same meaning. In
each the sacrifice was an offering to <i>Ti-ra&acute;-wa</i>. Perhaps
next in importance to these were the buffalo
dance and the corn dance, which were special ceremonies
to implore a blessing on the hunt and on the
harvest.</p>

<p>The first animal killed on the hunt was sacrificed.
It was necessary that this animal should be either a
deer or a buffalo; the first one killed on the hunt of
these two kinds. They were not permitted to kill
any other sort of an animal, save only these two,
until after the sacrifice had been made.</p>

<p>When this first animal had been killed, it was
brought into the camp, and taken to the sacred
lodge, and there the priests themselves went through
the secret ceremonies. Then they divided the meat,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>362]</a></span>
and took a part of it to the southeast end of the village.
There they built a fire of sticks, and placed
the meat on it. As the fire burned the flesh, the
whole tribe marched slowly and reverently by the
fire, and grasped handfuls of the smoke, and rubbed
it over their bodies and arms, and prayed, saying,
&ldquo;Now, you, <i>Ti-ra&acute;-wa</i>, the Ruler, look at your children,
and bless them; keep them and have mercy
upon them, and care for them.&rdquo; If any could not
understand, such as little children, their elders, who
did understand&mdash;their relations&mdash;prayed for them.
The sick were carried out to the place, and prayed,
and the smoke was rubbed over them. The young
men would run races, starting from a certain place,
and going around the village until they came to the
place where the smoke of the sacrifice rose.</p>

<p>The sacrifice, by burning of the scalp, was a very
elaborate performance, and occupied a whole day.
The high priest faced the east and prayed, and sang
twelve times. Descriptions of it given me in general
terms indicate that this ceremony was extremely interesting.
It was rather unusual, but was performed
once in 1877.</p>

<p>The sacrifice of the captive has not been practiced
by the Skidi for a long time, perhaps forty or fifty
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>363]</a></span>
years. Bear Chief told me that he had witnessed it
six times; Eagle Chief, who is, perhaps, between
fifty and sixty years old, says he has seen it once.
The old Skidi described the ceremony as follows:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Skidi alone of the Pawnees sacrificed human
beings to <i>Ti-ra&acute;-wa</i>. When they had returned home
from war successful, bringing captives with them,
they selected one of these for the sacrifice. The
others were adopted into the tribe, but this one, who
must be young and stout, one who would fatten
easily, was kept apart, eating by himself, fed on the
best of food and treated with the greatest kindness.
No hint of the fate in store for him was given until
the day of the sacrifice. For four nights before
that day the people danced; and for four days they
feasted. Each day after they had got through
feasting, the dishes were taken to their especial
place. Each woman, after she got through eating,
rose, and said to the prisoner, &lsquo;I have finished eating,
and I hope that I may be blessed from <i>Ti-ra&acute;-wa</i>;
that he may take pity on me; that when I put my
seed in the ground they may grow, and that I may
have plenty of everything.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;At the end of the four days two old men went,
one to each end of the village, and called aloud,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>364]</a></span>
directing every male person in the village to make a
bow and an arrow, and to be ready for the sacrifice.
For every male child that had been born a bow and
an arrow was made; for the little boys small bows
that they could bend and small arrows. The arrows
must be feathered with the feathers of the eagle, or
of some bird of prey, a hawk, an owl or an eagle.
They must not cut the feathers nor burn them to
make them low.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The next day, before daybreak, every one was
ready. All of the warriors, who had led parties on
the warpath, took from their sacred bundles their
collars, made from the feathers of the bird they
wore,<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> and put them on their backs and tied them
about their necks. They held their pipes in their
left hands, to signify that they were warriors. Every
male carried his bow and arrow. Every woman had
a lance or a stick. Just before daylight they all
went out to the west end of the village, and stood
there looking for the prisoner to be brought. Here
two stout posts had been set up, one of ash and the
other of hackberry, and between these had been tied
four cross-poles, the three lower ones to aid in climbing
up to the highest of the four.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_12_12" id="Footnote_12_12"></a><a href="#FNanchor_12_12"><span class="label">[12]</span></a>
The Purple Martin, <i>Progne subis</i>.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>365]</a></span>
&ldquo;As day broke, the people, looking back toward
the village, could see the captive being led toward
them, bound hand and foot. Behind him, as he
was led along, followed a warrior carrying the heart
and tongue of a buffalo; after him came another,
carrying a blazing stick, then one with a bow and
arrow, and last a warrior with the stuffed skin of an
owl.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They led the naked captive to the posts, and
lifting him up, tied first the left hand and then the
right to the top cross-pole, and afterward tied the
feet below. Every one stood there silent, looking,
waiting; the men holding their weapons and the
women their sticks and lances. On the ground
under the sacrifice was laid the wood for a great
fire, which was now lighted. Then the man with
the blazing stick stepped forward, but before he
reached the captive, the warrior with the bow and
arrow, he who had taken the captive, ran up close to
the victim and shot him through from side to side,
beneath the arms, with the sacred arrow, whose
point was of flint, such as they used in the olden
time. After the blood had run down upon the fire
below, the warrior who carried the buffalo tongue
and the heart, placed them on the fire beneath the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>366]</a></span>
body. When this had been done the man who
carried the owl ran up, and seized the burning stick
and burned the body, once under each arm, and
once in each groin, in all four times. Then, at a
given signal, the males all ran up, and shot their
arrows into the body. If any male children were
not large enough to shoot, some one shot for them.
There were so many arrows that the body was stuck
full of them; it bristled with them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A man chosen for this purpose now climbed up,
and pulled out all the arrows from the body, except
the one which was first shot through the side of the
sacrifice, and placed them together in a pile on the
ground, where they were left. After pulling out the
arrows, this man took his knife and cut open the
breast of the captive, and putting his hand in the
opening, took out a handful of blood, and smeared
it over his face, and then jumped to the ground, and
ran away as fast as he could. Each of the four men,
after he had done his part, ran away very fast, and
went down to the river and washed himself. When
this had been done the women came with their sticks
and spears and struck the body and counted <i>coup</i>
on it. Even the little children struck it. After they
had done this, they put their sticks together on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>367]</a></span>
ground in a pile, and left them there. By this time
the fire was burning up high and scorching the
body, and it was kept up until the whole body was
consumed. And while the smoke of the blood and
the buffalo meat, and of the burning body, ascended
to the sky, all the people prayed to <i>Ti-ra&acute;-wa</i>, and
walked by the fire and grasped handfuls of the
smoke, and passed it over their bodies and over
those of their children, and prayed <i>Ti-ra&acute;-wa</i> to
take pity on them, and to give them health, and
success in war, and plenteous crops. The man who
had killed the captive fasted and mourned for four
days, and asked <i>Ti-ra&acute;-wa</i> to take pity on him, for
he knew that he had taken the life of a human being.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This sacrifice always seemed acceptable to <i>Ti-ra&acute;-wa</i>,
and when the Skidi made it they always
seemed to have good fortune in war, and good crops,
and they were always well.</p>

<p>&ldquo;After the sacrifice was over, then came the old
women to rejoice over what had been done. They
would act as the warriors used to do, when coming
back from a war party. They carried the mother
corn. They went to the body and counted <i>coup</i> on
it, and then went back to the village. Some of them
would take the large hollow stalks of the sunflower,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>368]</a></span>
and put dust in them, and then blow it out, pretending
to shoot, the puff of dust standing for the smoke
of a shot. They would go up to the secret lodge,
and standing outside of it, would tell the story of
how they came to go on their pretended war party,
and what they did while they were gone, and what
enemies they struck&mdash;the whole long story. The
people meanwhile would stand about and laugh at
them as they did these things. Imitating the warriors,
the old women changed their names also.
One of the leading old women once took the name
&lsquo;Mud on the Meat,&rsquo; another, &lsquo;Skunk Skin Tobacco
Pouch,&rsquo; another &lsquo;Sitting Fish Old Man,&rsquo; another
&lsquo;Old Man Stepping on the Heart.&rsquo; The old men
standing about would joke with the old women, and
these would joke and make fun of each other.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The different acts of this sacrifice appear to have
been typical of the deeds and necessities of warfare.
Thus the feathers of the eagle used on the
arrows shot into the captive represented success in
war. Their use was a prayer to <i>Ti-ra&acute;-wa</i> that, as
these birds were fierce and successful when making
an attack, so those who shot might be fierce in war
and always conquerors. The burning of the body of
the captive with the blazing stick, perhaps, typified
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>369]</a></span>
the lighting of the sacred pipe, which could only be
done by one who had sacrificed a scalp. The shooting
arrows into the body by the males and the
striking it by the women typified the killing of and
counting <i>coup</i> on the enemy. The cutting open the
belly was the first act in the sacrifice of the animal,
the burnt offering.</p>

<p>It will be noted that this account differs in many
particulars from that given by Mr. Dunbar in his
papers on this people, but I think it worth recording,
as being an independent relation by a very old man,
who, I have no doubt, has been an eye-witness of
more than one of these remarkable sacrifices.</p>

<p>I know of no satisfactory and detailed account of
any of the sacred dances of the Pawnees. There
were many of these, among them the corn dance, the
buffalo dance, the wild horse dance, the deer, bear,
dog dances and so on. I give below an account of
the corn dance, as detailed to me by Curly Chief,
who said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The windy month [March] was the one in which
<i>Ti-ra&acute;-wa</i> gave us the seed to cultivate. The first
moon of April is the one during which they had a
special worship about the corn. Until these ceremonies
had been performed no one would clear out
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>370]</a></span>
the patch where they intended to plant the crop.
Everybody waited for this time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Kit-ke-hahk&acute;-i was the only tribe in which this
special ceremony was handed down. The Chau-i
and Pita-hau-erat worshiped with them. The preparations
for this dance are always made by a woman.
She has to think about it a long time before she can
make up her mind to undertake it. In making ready
for the dance, she must furnish the dried meat made
from the whole of a buffalo, fat and lean, every part
of it. The sack which holds the heart she dries, and
fills it with all the kinds of corn&mdash;the five colors, the
blue corn, which represents the blue sky, the red
corn, which stands for the evening sunset, the yellow
corn, which typifies the morning sunrise, the white
corn, which stands for a white cloud, and the spotted
corn, which represents the sky dotted with clouds.
All these she puts in the bag, placing in the sack
three grains of each at a time. On the special day
which has been fixed for the dance, she must offer
these things to <i>Ti-ra&acute;-wa</i>. The people are all
gathered together, the women standing on the outside
of the circle behind, and the men on the inner
side of the circle in front. This is a woman&rsquo;s dance,
and yet the men are there in front of the women.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>371]</a></span>
These men are the leading warriors of the tribe.
They have been off on the warpath, and in time of
corn have gone to the enemy. They have been successful
in war, and therefore they are with the women.
They stand about the circle holding their pipes in
their left hands, showing that they are leaders of
war parties, and each with the skin of a particular
bird<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> tied on top of the head, showing that they are
warriors.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_13_13" id="Footnote_13_13"></a><a href="#FNanchor_13_13"><span class="label">[13]</span></a>
A Martin, <i>Progne</i>.</p>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;The floor of the lodge must be hard, and swept
as clean as it can be. On the left hand side as you
look toward the door is a buffalo skull.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When the day has come all the people are gathered
together and are standing about the lodge. The
high priest stands at the back of the lodge with the
sacred bundles of the three bands before him. Then
this leading woman comes forward, and presents to
the high priest the dried meat and the sack of corn,
and two ancient, sacred hoes, made from the shoulder-blade
of a buffalo, bound to a handle by the
neck ligament. She places them on the ground before
the sacred bundles, the corn in the middle, and
the two hoes on either side. With these things she
also presents a sacred pipe, filled and ready for lighting,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>372]</a></span>
taken from a sacred bundle. Then she steps
back.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The old high priest must well know the ceremonies
to be performed. He prays to <i>Ti-ra&acute;-wa</i> and lights
the sacred pipe, blowing smoke to heaven, to the
earth, and to the four points of the compass. While
the ceremonies are going on, the buffalo skull is
taken to the sacred place in this lodge, and put in a
particular position. Then the leading woman steps
forward again, followed by two others. She takes
the bag of corn, and the other two women take the
hoes, and they stand in front of the high priest. He
sings and prays. The leading woman stands in a
particular position, as directed by the high priest,
holding the bag of corn up to the sky in both her
hands; and as he sings, she raises and lowers it in
time to the music of the song.</p>

<p>&ldquo;After these ceremonies the women come forward,
holding their hoes in their hands, and dance about
the lodge one after another in single file, following
the leading woman. Four times they dance about
the lodge. She cannot pass the priest the fifth time.
These ceremonies and the songs and prayers were to
ask for a blessing on the hunt and on the corn, and
to learn whether they would be blessed in both.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>373]</a></span>
After the women had danced and gone back to their
places, everybody looked on the floor of the lodge
to see whether there were any buffalo hairs there. If
they saw them, they all said, &lsquo;Now we are going to
be successful in our hunt and in our corn.&rsquo; Everybody
said, &lsquo;We are blessed.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then when they would go out on the hunt they
would find plenty of buffalo, and the messenger sent
back to the village from the hunt would return to the
camp and say, &lsquo;We have plenty of corn.&rsquo; If they
saw a great many buffalo hairs they would get many
buffalo; if but few they would get some buffalo.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The next day after these ceremonies every one
would begin to clear up their patches and get ready
to plant corn. The leading woman who prepared
the dance is respected and highly thought of. After
that she is like a chief.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This ceremony is the next principal thing we
have after the burnt offering of the animal and of
the scalp. We did not invent this. It came to us
from the Ruler, and we worship him through it. He
gave us the corn and blessed us through it. By it
we are made strong.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are like seed and we worship through the
corn.&rdquo;</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>374]</a></span></p>

<h4><a name="notes_4_3" id="notes_4_3"></a>III. MEDICINE AND MYSTERY.</h4>

<p>It has been said that the &ldquo;medicine men&rdquo; or doctors
among the Pawnees occupied a position by themselves.
Their guild was entirely distinct from that
of the priests. A priest might be a doctor as well,
but not because he was a priest.</p>

<p>The doctors were primarily healers. Their function
was to fight disease. Like many other savage
nations, the Pawnees believed that sickness was
caused by evil spirits, which had entered into the
patient and must be driven out if he was to recover.
In their treatment of injuries the doctors were often
singularly successful. Major North has cited for me
a number of instances, in which men, whose hurts
had refused to yield to the treatment of the United
States Army surgeons, had been cured by Pawnee
doctors. Some of these have been detailed elsewhere.
As might be imagined, however, the Pawnee
treatment of disease was less efficacious. Simple
ailments were often treated with success by means
of the familiar sudatory, or &ldquo;sweat house;&rdquo; but in
the case of more serious complaints, the dancing and
rattling, which constitute so large a part of the doctor&rsquo;s
treatment, tend to aggravate rather than to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>375]</a></span>
check the disease. I have not space to discuss the
very interesting subject of the system of therapeutics
practiced by the Pawnee doctors. Mr. Dunbar has
gone into this matter quite fully, and the reader is
referred to his papers for an account of their practice.</p>

<p>As the doctors had to fight evil spirits, it is not
surprising that they should have summoned magic
to their aid; but this magic probably served its more
important purpose in impressing the other Indians
with a belief in the doctors&rsquo; powers. Some of the
performances which took place at the doctors&rsquo; dances
were very marvellous, and most of them were quite
inexplicable to those who saw what was done. That
they should have imposed on the Indian spectator is
perhaps not surprising; but it is further to be noted
that clear-headed, intelligent white men, whose powers
of observation have been highly trained, have
confessed themselves wholly unable to explain these
startling performances, or to hazard a guess as to
the means by which they were accomplished. That
these things happened as detailed is well authenticated
by the testimony of many perfectly credible
witnesses.</p>

<p>Other masters of mystery are provided with mechanical
aids of one kind or another&mdash;some apparatus
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>376]</a></span>
which assists them in imposing on their audiences,
by concealing certain objects, or certain acts, by
means of which they cause things to appear different
from what they really are. The Pawnee doctors had
nothing of this. Their dances were conducted by
naked men in a ring surrounded by spectators. The
floor of bare earth, packed hard and worn smooth
by the tread of many feet, afforded no apparent opportunity
for concealment or trickery. Under such
conditions were performed their mysteries, a few of
which I will mention as they appeared to watchful
spectators, distant not more than twenty-five or thirty
feet, and often much nearer.</p>

<p>The simplest performances were the swallowing of
spears and arrows. These feats were merely mechanical,
and were no doubt really as they appeared, the
arrows and the spears being driven down the gullet
to the distance of a foot or eighteen inches. Instances
occurred where men who had swallowed
arrows died from the injuries received in the operation.
Bear Chief, himself a doctor, and tattooed
with a bear on the right side, told me that it was
much harder and more painful to swallow an arrow
than a spear.</p>

<p>Among the more remarkable performances
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>377]</a></span>
witnessed and vouched for by my friend, Captain L.&nbsp;H.
North, are the following:</p>

<p>Several men, representing elk, came into the ring,
and trotted about, so as to be seen by every one,
imitating the movements of those animals. To their
heads were tied branches to represent horns, and
each wore an elk skin thrown over his back. A doctor
came into the ring, and handed to the spectators
his arrows, which they examined, and found to be
ordinary arrows with the usual sheet-iron points.
On receiving back the arrows from those who had
examined them, the doctor pretended to hunt the
elk, and at length shot at them, striking them in the
sides or on the legs. The arrows, instead of penetrating
the flesh, bounded back, some of them flying
fifteen or twenty feet in the air. They appeared to
be shot with the full force of the bow, and when
picked up and handed to the onlookers, the sheet-iron
points were found to be doubled back as if they
had been shot against a plate of iron, and the shafts
of some of them were split. The elk trotted away
and out of the ring without injury.</p>

<p>A man, representing an enemy, came into the ring
on foot. A doctor followed, armed with a hatchet,
which he passed to the spectators for examination.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>378]</a></span>
It was an ordinary hatchet of the tomahawk form.
On receiving back the hatchet, the doctor started in
pursuit of the enemy, who fled. The doctor overtook
him, and with a vigorous blow, sunk the hatchet
up to the handle in the enemy&rsquo;s skull, leaving it there.
The wounded man staggered on, passing within five
or six feet of the ring of spectators, who plainly saw
the blood from the wound running down the man&rsquo;s
face, and dripping from his hair behind. They saw
also the gray brain-matter oozing from the wound.
The wounded man was taken from the ring into the
doctor&rsquo;s lodge. A few days later he was seen about,
and in his usual health.</p>

<p>A small boy, six or eight years of age, was led
into the ring quite naked. He was placed upon the
ground, and two men sat upon him, one on his chest,
the other on his legs. With a knife an incision was
made in his belly; one of the doctors inserted his
fingers; and, after feeling about, pulled out of the
cut what looked like a portion of the child&rsquo;s liver.
This he cut off and gave to the other man, who ate
it. The remainder of the liver was crowded back
into the hole, and the boy was carried off. Subsequently
he was seen about, apparently in good health.</p>

<p>A man representing a bear came into the ring and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>379]</a></span>
was pursued by a number of Indians, who shot arrows
at him for some time, without appearing to injure
him. At length, however, an arrow pierced him
through the bowels, and the wound was plainly seen
on each side. The man fell, and appeared to be
dying. He was removed to the lodge, and in a
short time was entirely recovered.</p>

<p>Major North saw one of these bear performances,
in which, the pretended bear having attacked one of
his pursuers, the latter slashed him across the abdomen
with a large knife, inflicting a cut from which
the bowels hung down so that they dragged on the
ground. The bear was carried off, and in a short
time was healed, and went about as usual.</p>

<p>Major North told me that he saw with his own
eyes the doctors make the corn grow. This was in
the medicine lodge. In the middle of the lodge, the
doctor dug up a piece of the hard trodden floor of
the lodge, about as large as a dinner plate, and
broke up between his fingers the hard pieces of soil,
until the dirt was soft and friable. The ground
having thus been prepared, and having been moistened
with water, a few kernels of corn were buried
in the loose earth. Then the doctor retired a little
from the spot and sang, and as the place where the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>380]</a></span>
corn was buried was watched, the soil was seen to
move, and a tiny green blade came slowly into view.
This continued to increase in height and size, until
in the course of twenty minutes or half an hour from
the time of planting, the stalk of corn was a foot or
fifteen inches in height. At this point Major North
was obliged to leave the lodge, to take out a white
woman who was fainting from the heat, and so did
not see the maturing of the corn. All the Indians
and white men who remained assured him that the
stalks continued to grow until they were of full
height, and that they then tasseled out and put
forth one or more ears of corn, which grew to full
size, and that then the doctor approached the plant,
plucked an ear, and passed it to the spectators.</p>

<p>Similar to this was a feat performed with a cedar
berry. The berry was passed around among the
spectators for examination, and was then planted as
the corn had been. Then after a few moments the
doctor approached the spot, put his thumb and forefinger
down into the soft dirt, and seemed to lay
hold of something. Very slowly he raised his hand
and was seen to hold on the tips of his fingers the
end of a cedar twig. Slowly his hand was moved
from the ground, the twig growing longer and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>381]</a></span>
longer. When nine or ten inches high it began to
have side branches. The doctor still holding the
topmost twig of what was by this time a cedar bush,
continued to lift his hand very slowly, until it was
about three feet from the ground, and then let go of
the bush. Then presently he took hold of the stem
close to the ground, and, seeming to exert a good
deal of force, pulled up the bush by the roots; and
all the people saw the bush and its bunch of fresh
and growing roots.</p>

<p>Enough has been said of these mystery ceremonies
to indicate that they were very remarkable. The
circumstances under which they were performed
would seem to remove them from the more commonplace
tricks of professional jugglers. And I have
never found any one who could even suggest an
explanation of them.</p>

<p>As might be inferred, these mysterious doings
greatly impressed the Pawnees; and the older men
among them have a vast store of reminiscences of
past dances, which they delight in repeating. In
the course of a long talk with Bear Chief one
evening, he recounted a number of instances which
he had seen. He said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;A man in our tribe was blind; he could not see.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>382]</a></span>
He could travel in the night as well as we can in
the day, but when daylight came he could see nothing.
At one time he called together his relations,
and told them that, though blind, he wished to lead
out a war party. He said, &lsquo;I know that I, with my
party, will kill an enemy.&rsquo; They started out, a
young man leading him by the hand all day long.
After they had been out several days, he told the
young men to be ready, that the next morning he
was going to kill an enemy. The next morning,
while they were traveling along, they saw an enemy,
and surrounded and killed him. They took the
scalp and brought it home, and he had great credit,
because, being blind, he had killed an enemy. They
were all surprised that a blind man should have
killed an enemy. He sacrificed the scalp to <i>Ti-ra&acute;-wa</i>,
and was made a warrior, and went to the
sacred lodge and told the story of his campaign, and
was made a warrior&mdash;a blind warrior.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was a wonderful thing for a blind person to be
able to travel in the night. This must have come
from <i>Ti-ra&acute;-wa</i>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One of the wonderful things done by this man
was at a medicine dance. Everybody was there.
He stood up with his bearskin over him, and was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>383]</a></span>
led out before the people. A cedar branch was
given him, and he sharpened the end where it had
been cut off, and stuck it in the ground. Everybody
was now asked to pull up this branch, and many
tried to do so, but the strongest men in the tribe
could not move it. He could pull it up, as if it were
stuck in the mud. He thrust the pointed end in the
ground again, and asked the doctors to pull up the
cedar branch. They tried to do so, but could not stir
it. The chiefs also were asked to try to do this.
They tried, but could not move it. Something
seemed to hold it in the ground. After everybody
had tried to pull it up, and failed, this blind man
went to it, and taking hold of it, pulled with all his
strength, and pulled up with it about six feet of
roots. There lay the tree with all it roots fresh and
growing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There was, in my young days, a certain brave
man in the tribe. His name was Elk Left Behind.
He was so brave that, when the Sioux surrounded him,
he would kill so many that he would scare the rest
away. In one of the doctors&rsquo; dances he had the skin
of a fawn in his hands. He called out to the people,
&lsquo;Now, you people, watch me; look close and see
what I shall do, and you will find out what my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>384]</a></span>
bravery is, and that it all comes from this that you
see.&rsquo; In our presence he shook this fawn skin, and
the fawn slipped out of his hands and then stood
before him, a living fawn looking at him. &lsquo;That is
what I mean,&rsquo; said he. &lsquo;If the enemies surround
me, that is the way I come out of it. The fawn can
run so fast that it can never be caught, nor can it
ever be shot.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This man was wonderful. He used to imitate
the deer and the elk. He could never be driven into
timber or brush, or where there were thickets. He
said, &lsquo;If I am ever wounded, it will be when I go
into timber or brush.&rsquo; He always wanted to be in
the open plain where he could be surrounded. He
never ran to the timber for shelter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If they suspected that the Sioux were coming to
attack the village, he would load a gun and shoot it
off. If the ball came back to him, there were no
Sioux coming. If it did not, then they would be
coming. When I was present it always came back
to him. There were no Sioux coming.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At one time in the doctors&rsquo; dance I saw him driving
ten young men, who pretended that they were
deer. He had a gun and loaded it, and shot the ten
men, one after another, through the side. They fell
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>385]</a></span>
down wounded, and then got up and limped off half
dying. He drove them around the ring so that the
people might see their wounds. After they had
looked at them, he went up to the first and slapped
him on the back, and the ball dropped out of him on
to the ground, and the man straightened up, healed.
So he did to all, up to the tenth man, and they were
all healed. This was wonderful.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>386]</a></span>
&ldquo;At one time he wanted to show the people that
he could stand anything. He and two others were
attacked by Sioux. He said, &lsquo;I want to be wounded;
let us go to the thickets.&rsquo; They did so, and a Sioux
shot him through the back, and the other two were
wounded, but he healed them all after they had got
away from the Sioux.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Another man in the doctors&rsquo; dance had four
young men pretend that they were horses. All had
manes and tails, and were painted to imitate horses.
He had a gun, to which was tied a scalp. He loaded
the gun, and while he was doing this the horses
ran off, and stood looking back at the man. He
cocked the gun and laid it on the ground pointing
toward the horses, and placed the scalp near the
trigger, and walked some steps away. Then he
motioned to the scalp and the gun went off, and one
of the horses went down wounded. It seems that
the ghost of the scalp obeyed his motion, and shot
off the gun. He loaded the gun again, and placed
it on the ground as before. The second time he
went way off, and as soon as he waved his hand and
said, &lsquo;<i>wooh</i>,&rsquo; the gun went off and another horse
went down. This was repeated until all the horses
were down. The people examined them and saw
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>387]</a></span>
that they were really wounded in the breast. The
man went up to them and they seemed to be dying
and vomited blood, and the young man slapped them,
and the balls came out of their mouths, and as soon
as the balls came away from them they were healed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There were two people, a brother and sister,
children of a man who had been helped by a bear.
One time when we were having a doctors&rsquo; dance,
the sister and brother came forward, each carrying
five cedar branches about three feet long. They
rolled a big rock into the middle of the lodge, so
that all might see what they were going to do.
Then they called ten private men who were not
doctors, and told them to thrust the ends of the
branches into the stone as if they had grown there,
and they sang:</p>

<div class="cpoem">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;&lsquo;See the trees growing in the rock;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The cedar tree grows in the rock.&rsquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;These cedar branches were cut square off at the
butt, and were set on the stone. They were not big
enough to be even and balance, but still they stood
upright, as if grown from the rock. The doctors
tried to blow them down with their fans made of

men who put them there were told to take them off.

would make the plums grow, and shaking the tree,
they would fall down, and everybody would have a
taste of them. This was at a doctors&rsquo; dance.&rdquo;</p>

<h4><a name="notes_5_1" id="notes_5_1"></a>I. REMOVAL TO THE INDIAN TERRITORY.</h4>

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE project of removing the Pawnees from
their reservation on the Loup River in
Nebraska appears to have been first heard of in
the year 1872. The Pawnee reservation was close
to civilization, and the settlers moving west into
Nebraska coveted the Indians&rsquo; lands. It was the
old story, the same one that has been heard ever
since the rapacious whites first set foot on the shores
of this continent.</p>

<p>The Pawnees were strongly attached to their
home in Nebraska. They had always lived there,
and were used to it. Their forefathers were buried
there. Up to the winter of 1873-74 they had no
idea of moving. But they were constantly being
subjected to annoyances.</p>

<p>Settlers crowded in close to the Pawnee agency,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>390]</a></span>
and even located on it on the south and east, and in
the most matter of fact way drove their teams into
the Pawnee timber, and cut and carried off the Pawnee
wood, on which the tribe depended for fuel and
for building materials. This open robbery gave
rise to constant disputes and bickerings between the
Indians and the whites, in which the former were invariably
worsted. On the south and east side of the
reservation the crowding and the depredations were
continuous. On the north and west the reservation
was exposed to frequent incursions from the different
bands of Sioux. War parties came down from their
reservations, stole the Pawnees&rsquo; horses, killed their
women while at work in the fields, and sometimes
even attacked the village. These attacks, though
always successfully repelled by the Pawnees, were a
continual source of annoyance and irritation to them,
while their consistent desire to obey the rules laid
down for their guidance by the Government prevented
them from retaliating in kind upon their
enemies.</p>

<p>The first proposition to remove the Pawnees to
the Indian Territory originated with the whites, but
there is some reason to think that an independent
movement with the same object in view was made by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>391]</a></span>
members of the Pawnee tribe. As nearly as I can
learn from conversation with Indians who took a
leading part in the movement, this project for a removal
of a part of the tribe to the south originated
with Lone Chief, the Kit-ke-hahk&acute;-i; and was taken
up and supported by Left Hand, known also as Spotted
Horse, a turbulent spirit, who was killed a few
years ago by an United States marshal; and by Frank
White, an intelligent soldier of the Chau-i band.</p>

<p>In the summer of 1870, Lone Chief led a visiting
party, which is said to have numbered three hundred
men, south to the Wichitas. When this party turned
back to go north in the fall, many of them were sick
with chills and fever&mdash;a disease unknown to them
until that time&mdash;and some died on the way. At this
time the notion of the removal had not been suggested,
but it is probable that even then Lone Chief
was considering the advisability of moving south with
his own immediate family, and taking up his residence
with the Wichitas. He had not yet spoken of
this project, however, but in the winter of 1871-72
he announced his intention of doing this, and even
started on his journey, but for some reason turned
back.</p>

<p>The next winter&mdash;1872-73&mdash;while the tribe was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>392]</a></span>
absent on the buffalo hunt, the northern Sioux came
down and stole from the Pawnees a number of
horses. This made the Pawnees uneasy, and some
war parties started out. It was at this time that Lone
Chief conceived the idea of increasing the company
which should proceed south with him. After some
consideration and consultation, Lone Chief, Spotted
Horse and Frank White planned that a small party
should go south, and visit the different tribes in the
Indian Territory, for the purpose of learning how
these tribes would regard a general movement of
the Pawnees down into their country. The plan was
not fully developed until this small party, of which
Spotted Horse and Frank White were the leaders,
was on its way.</p>

<p>The party visited first the Otoes and Kaws, and
then going south came to the Wichitas, Comanches,
Kiowas and Apaches, and were everywhere hospitably
entertained, and given presents of horses. They
asked the chiefs and headmen of the various tribes
which they visited to come together at a certain
specified time at the Wichita camp, telling them that
they had something that they wished to say to them
there. The Pawnees then returned to the Wichita
village, and awaited the appointed time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>393]</a></span>
Soon the representatives of the different tribes
began to arrive. Day after day they kept coming in,
until all were present. When they had assembled in
council, Spotted Horse rose to speak. He said, &ldquo;My
brothers, I want you to know one thing&mdash;We, the
Pawnees, want to be brothers, and to be at peace. I
have made up my mind to come down here with my
party of Pawnees to live with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The chiefs representing the different tribes all expressed
their satisfaction at this announcement, and
urged him to come as he had intended. They said,
&ldquo;We have good land here, and lots of buffalo. We
shall be glad if you decide to come.&rdquo; After all had
spoken, Spotted Horse again stood up and said,
&ldquo;Brothers, there is here with me one leading man
among the Pawnees. He, also, will tell you what he
thinks about this.&rdquo; Frank White then spoke and
said that he intended to accompany Spotted Horse
when he should move south. The chiefs of the different
tribes again expressed the hope that they
would carry out their intentions, and arrangements
were made with the tribes that they should come
down and live with them.</p>

<p>It is stated that just before this visiting party
started north toward their home, news came from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>394]</a></span>
Pawnee agency that the tribe had been attacked and
massacred on the Republican River by Sioux, and as
they journeyed north they learned the details of the
occurrence. On reaching the village, Spotted Horse
and Frank White reported to Lone Chief and to
their families what they had done, and their action
was confirmed. The chiefs of the tribe and the
agent were then notified. Soon afterward a general
council was held, at which public announcement of
their intention was made by these three men. To
most of those present the project was wholly new,
and there was a good deal of confusion in the council,
the people exclaiming at the news and discussing
it.</p>

<p>Efforts were made by the chiefs of the bands to
dissuade those who proposed to move. The Head
Chief, <i>Pi&acute;ta Le-shar</i>, tried to persuade Frank White
not to leave the tribe, but he said that he had promised,
and he should go.</p>

<p>In the autumn of 1873, Lone Chief, Spotted Horse
and Frank White, accompanied by their personal following,
started south. With them went about two-thirds
of the tribe. The three leaders had a pass
from the Superintendent of Indian Affairs at the
Pawnee agency. The chiefs of the tribe were still
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>395]</a></span>
bitterly opposed to the notion of the removal, and
<i>Pi&acute;ta Le-shar</i>, the Head Chief, exerted all his influence
to prevent the movement. After the migrating party
had gone about fifty miles, messengers from the
chiefs overtook them, directing them to return to the
village. The march was stopped, and the three
leaders, as delegates, returned to the agency to learn
the cause of the order. They reached there in the
evening, and spent the whole night conferring with
the agent (Burgess), to whom they gave presents to
persuade him to accede to their request to continue
their journey. Lone Chief was the most determined,
and insisted that they should be permitted to go on
without interference.</p>

<p>At length the authorities yielded, and a new pass
having been given them, they returned to the camp.
The responsibility of taking away so large a part of
the tribe was weighing heavily on these three men,
however, and they determined to send back all except
their own families. On reaching the camp, therefore,
they told the Indians that they all were to go back,
but hid their own horses, pretending that they had
strayed off, so that the main body would start back
without them. After the others had moved out of
camp on their return march to the agency, the lost
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>396]</a></span>
horses were at once found, and the three men with
their families went on south.</p>

<p>The following year all the tribe followed, except
the Skidi, Lone Chief, and a few personal friends,
who still refused to leave the old reservation. This
small company remained in their old home one year
longer, and then they, too, went south to their
present reservation.</p>

<p>Shortly before the removal of the tribe to the
Indian Territory in 1874, <i>Pi&acute;ta Le-shar</i>, the Head
Chief, was shot, and died from his wound. It has
been stated, and generally believed, that his death
resulted from the accidental discharge of his own
pistol, but there are well-informed persons who
believe that he was murdered. There is reason to
believe that the shot did not come from his own
weapon, but that he was shot by a white man in order
to get rid of his influence, which was consistently
exerted to keep the Pawnees in their northern home.
The Chief&rsquo;s wound was not a serious one, and he
was doing well under the charge of a white surgeon,
when he was induced to put himself in the care of a
Pawnee doctor, under whose treatment he died.</p>

<p><i>Ti-ra&acute;-wa Le-shar</i>, another bitter opponent of removal,
had been killed in 1873; and the death of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>397]</a></span>
<i>Pi&acute;ta Le-shar</i> left Lone Chief, Skidi, the only man of
strong character to oppose the movement.</p>

<p>The full history of the plot to eject the Pawnees
from their northern home may never be recorded, for
there are few men alive who know the facts. If it
should be written there would be disclosed a carefully
planned and successfully carried out conspiracy
to rob this people of their lands. This outrage has
cost hundreds of lives, and an inconceivable amount
of suffering, and is another damning and ineffaceable
blot on the record of the American people,
and one which ought surely to have had a place in
Mrs. Jackson&rsquo;s &ldquo;Century of Dishonor.&rdquo;</p>


<h4><a name="notes_5_2" id="notes_5_2"></a>II. PRESENT CONDITION AND PROGRESS.</h4>

<p>During the first four years of their sojourn in the
Indian Territory the condition of the Pawnees was
most miserable.</p>

<p>They had left the high, dry, sandy country of the
Loup, and come south into the more fertile, but also
more humid country of the Indian Territory, where
they found a region entirely different from that to
which they had been accustomed. Soon after their
settlement on their new reservation, they were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>398]</a></span>
attacked by fever and ague, a disease which had been
unknown to them in their northern home, and many
of them died, while all were so weakened by disease
and so discouraged by homesickness that their nature
seemed wholly changed. They lost their old spirit
and their energy, and were possessed only by a
desire to return to their northern home. This was,
of course, impossible, since their old reservation had
been thrown open to settlement, and in part occupied
by the whites. During the first ten years of their
sojourn in the Territory more than one of the agents
appointed to look after the Pawnees were either incompetent
or dishonest, so that the people suffered
from lack of food, and some of them even starved to
death. They were miserably poor, for they did not
know how to work, and no one tried to encourage
or help them to do so. The few horses which they
had were stolen from them by white horse thieves,
and they were now in a country and under conditions
where they could not practice their old war methods.
The tribes against which their expeditions had once
been made were now their neighbors and their
friends.</p>

<p>When Major North and his brother Luther visited
the agency in 1876, to enlist scouts for General
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>399]</a></span>
Crook&rsquo;s northern campaign, they found the Pawnees
in a pitiable condition. They were without food,
without clothing, without arms and without horses.
Their sole covering consisted of cotton sheets, which
afforded no protection against cold and wet. It is
not strange that under such circumstances the people
died off fast. At this time Major North had
orders to enlist only one hundred scouts, but he was
greatly perplexed in selecting his men, for four hundred
wanted to go with him. Every able-bodied
man in the tribe, and many who were not able-bodied,
tried to get their names on the muster roll. Each
man, at any cost, sought to get away from the suffering
of his present life; from the fever that made him
quake, the chill that caused him to shiver, and above
all from the deadly monotony of the reservation life.
After Major North had enlisted his quota of men
and started with them on his way north, more than
a hundred others followed him on foot to Arkansas
City, in the hope that he could be persuaded to increase
his force, or else that some of those enlisted
would drop out through sickness, and there might be
room for others.</p>

<p>The wretched condition of the Pawnees continued
up to about 1884 or 1885. Before this time the people
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>400]</a></span>
had become in a measure acclimated in their
new home, and had come to realize that it was absolutely
necessary for them to go to work if the tribe
was to continue to exist. They began to work; at
first only a few, but gradually many, of the Skidi,
and then the Chau-i and the Kit-ke-hahk&acute;-i. Presently
a point was reached where it was no longer necessary
to issue them Government rations. They raised
enough on their farms to support themselves. Each
year of late they have done better and better. A
drought one season, and a cyclone another, destroyed
their crops, but, undiscouraged and undaunted, they
push ahead, striving earnestly to become like white
men. The Pita-hau-erats are the least progressive of
the four bands, and many of them still live in dirt
lodges, and cultivate patches of corn scarcely larger
than those tilled in their old villages; but as the
other bands advance, and as the results of manual
labor are seen and understood by those who are
more idle, they, too, will catch the spirit of progress,
and will lay hold of the plow.</p>

<p>Last March, as I drove along toward the agency,
and as we came in sight of Black Bear Creek, I
was surprised to see what looked like good farm
houses dotting the distant bottom. A nearer view
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>401]</a></span>
and a closer investigation showed me that the most
well-to-do of the Pawnees live in houses as good as
those of many a New England land owner, and very
much better than those inhabited by new settlers in
the farther West. Many of them have considerable
farms under fence, a barn, a garden in which vegetables
are raised, and a peach orchard. They
realize that as yet they are only beginning, but to
me, who knew them in their old barbaric condition,
their progress seems a marvel. Nowadays by far
the greater number of the Pawnees wear civilized
clothing, ride in wagons, and send their children to
the agency school. They are making rapid strides
toward civilization, just such progress as might be
expected from the intelligent and courageous people
that they are and always have been.</p>

<p>The Pawnees receive from the Government a perpetual
annuity of thirty thousand dollars, of which
one-half is paid in money, and one-half in goods.
Besides this they have a credit with the Government
of about two hundred and eighty thousand dollars
(the proceeds of the sale of their old reservation in
Nebraska), on which they receive interest; and for
some years past they have leased to cattlemen about
one hundred and twenty-five thousand acres of their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>402]</a></span>
reservation, for which they receive about three
thousand eight hundred dollars per annum. It will
thus be seen that in addition to the crops which they
raise, the tribe is fairly well provided with money.
While a considerable part of this is, of course, wasted,
being spent for trifles and for luxuries, it is nevertheless
the fact that a certain proportion of it is invested
by the Indians in tools, farming implements, and in
furniture. Three years ago the Indians merely
dropped their corn into the furrow, while some
planted with a hoe. There was then only one corn-planter
on the reservation. Now there are thirteen
of these implements of improved pattern, bought by
the Indians, and paid for with their own money.
Reapers and mowers belong to the Indian Department,
and are loaned, not issued, and these pass
round from one family to another. Within the last
four years one hundred breaking and stirring plows
have been issued, and one hundred and five double
shovel cultivators. Eighty wagons and one hundred
and fifty sets of harness have been issued in the same
length of time. Besides these, eight two-horse cultivators
are loaned them by the Government.</p>

<p>The Pawnees seem to be saving up their money to
put into farming implements, and they are looking
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>403]</a></span>
ahead. Two-thirds of the houses built in the last
three years have been built by the Chau-i, who are
pushing the Skidi hard in their advance toward
civilization.</p>

<p>The following table, taken from the official papers
of the Indian Bureau, gives some statistics as to the
progress made by the Pawnees during the last three
years:</p>

<p>Twelve allotments of land made 1888. Whole number allotments
to date (1888), 175. In 1885 Indians sawed 50,050 feet
of lumber, and cut 126 cords of wood.</p>

<p>In 1886 the Indians hauled 83,814 pounds of freight, for
which they were paid $541.54.</p>

<p>During the year 1888 three Indian apprentices learned a
trade.</p>

<p>Besides the crops raised, the Indians during 1888 sawed
50,000 feet of lumber, and cut 300 cords of wood.</p>

<p>In 1886 a severe cyclone and hail storm destroyed the
growing crops, and in 1887 a prolonged drought again ruined
them. During these two years it was necessary to issue to the
Indians half rations and one-third rations respectively. This
year (1888-89) no rations have been issued.</p>

As will be seen by these figures, corn is the principal
crop raised by the Pawnees, and a large part of
the surplus beyond their own wants is sold at from
twenty-five to fifty cents a bushel to the dealers in
Arkansas City, or to the cattlemen in the neighborhood.
The Pawnees have as yet few cattle, their old
meat-eating habits have not yet been overcome, and
there is a tendency among them to eat any cattle they
may obtain rather than to use them for breeding purposes.
They ought to be encouraged to keep cattle,
to which they could feed their corn, and in this way
obtain a better return for their labor than is yielded
by the direct sale of the grain. They are fairly well
provided with horses, but most of these are small,
and of the old-fashioned Indian pony type. They
should be encouraged to raise a better class of
horses, and at least two well bred heavy stallions
should be kept by the Government at Pawnee for
Indian use. There is one now at Ponca, thirty-five
miles away, but the Pawnees will not take their mares
so far.</p>

<p>Much of the improvement in the condition of the
Pawnees has taken place within the last three years,
and much of it has been due, as I believe, to the
wisdom and judgment of Major Osborne, their agent,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>406]</a></span>
and to the Messrs. McKenzie, who have for three
years or more been the clerks directly in charge of
these people. These gentlemen appear to have been
honest and firm, and yet helpful in their treatment of
the people under their charge, and the results of their
administration show for themselves, and are something
in which these officials may feel a just pride.</p>

<p>Few and rapidly diminishing in numbers as are the
Pawnee people, I have yet confidence that by the
innate strength of their character their decline may
be checked, and their race may rise again. It can
never do so in its old purity. It must take to itself
fresh blood from other stocks, and thus renew its
vitality. What I hope for the Pawnee, to-day and in
the future, is that the native vigor of the race, the
strong heart and singleness of purpose, which in
ancient times led the wild brave to success on his
warpath, and gave his tribe so high a place among
the savage warriors of the plains, may now be exercised
in the pursuits of peace; and that the same
qualities may give to these earnest toilers, as they
tread new paths, strength, courage and endurance to
hold a front rank among those Indians, who, to-day
so far behind, are nevertheless resolutely setting
their steps toward a place with civilized people.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>407]</a></span>
But whatever the fate of the Pawnee people&mdash;whether,
like so many other native stocks, it shall
dwindle away and disappear, leaving behind it no
reminder of its existence, or whether its native force
shall enable it under its new conditions to survive and
make some mark&mdash;we may remember it always as a
race of strong, brave people, whose good qualities
are deserving of more than a passing tribute.</p>


<p class=" center lrgfont break"><sub>*</sub> <sup>*</sup> <sub>*</sub></p>


<p class="break">It was the last day of my stay at the Pawnee
agency. I had seen many an old friend; had laughed
and joked with some over incidents of former years,
and with others had mourned over brave warriors or
wise old men who were no longer with us. My visit
had been full of pleasure, and yet full of pain.
When I had first known the tribe it numbered more
than three thousand people, now there are only a
little more than eight hundred of them. The
evidences of their progress toward civilization are
cheering. They are now self-supporting. They no
longer die of hunger. But the character of the
people has changed. In the old barbaric days they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>408]</a></span>
were light-hearted, merry, makers of jokes, keenly
alive to the humorous side of life. Now they are
serious, grave, little disposed to laugh. Then they
were like children without a care. Now they are
like men, on whom the anxieties of life weigh heavily.
Civilization, bringing with it some measure of material
prosperity, has also brought to these people care, responsibility,
repression. No doubt it is best, and it
is inevitable, but it is sad, too.</p>

<p>It was my last day, and I was again sitting with
Eagle Chief, telling him that the time had come for
me to go. He said, &ldquo;Ah, my son, I like to see you
here. I like to sit with you, and to talk over the old
times. My heart is sick when I think that you are
going away, and that we may never see each other
any more. But,&rdquo; he added, solemnly, &ldquo;it may be
that <i>Ti-ra&acute;-wa</i> will be good to us, and will let us live
a long time until we are very old, and then some day
we may meet again.&rdquo;</p>

produced from scanned images of public domain material
from the Google Print project.)


Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
